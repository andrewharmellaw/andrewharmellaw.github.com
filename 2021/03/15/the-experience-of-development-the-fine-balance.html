<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúMy phrases have to be crammed with information. They have to be crammed with content.  Not that a compromise is necessary. I think that so much of what I do with language is instinctive. You see I don‚Äôt really think of myself as creating the language, because language pre-exists; I just have to go where it is. I have to find it and it has to find me; and it‚Äôs as much about listening as it is about being active. You have an inner voice where the perfect novel is kept; the perfect sentence is kept; and your task is to mediate that to the world outside; and that‚Äôs the writer‚Äôs daily business.</p>

  <p>But of course you don‚Äôt think of it like that, you just type fast. And because you‚Äôre accustomed, because you‚Äôve been doing this for years and years it‚Äôs like starting a song. The rhythm won‚Äôt falter. The internal logic of the prose won‚Äôt let you down. In the same way I think that with a long book you sometimes have to forget about structure and trust that it‚Äôs doing itself; and it is.</p>

  <p>But there‚Äôs such a fine balance between exerting absolute control, and letting go, so that the thing can happen.‚Äù<br />
Hilary Mantel interviewed by Michael Rosen for ‚ÄúWord of Mouth‚Äù on BBC Radio 4.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="newthought">Each of us approaches software development</span>  in our own individual way, based on both our understanding of the-thing-we-are-trying-to-make-slash-the-problem-we-are-trying-to-solve, and on our grasp of the tools with which we are working.</p>

<p>In doing so, three things‚Äìthe mental models that we construct, as well as the pre-existing mental models which we call upon, <em>and</em> the means by which we mediate them to the outside world‚Äìare potentially called into question every time the code itself, that external manifestation of these mental models and bearers of our expectations, tells us what it can and can‚Äôt do.  It is at this nexus that our internal conception of the-thing-we-are-trying-to-make-slash-the-problem-we-are-trying-to-solve is confronted with an alternate reality; the reality of syntax and compilers and CPU registers and electrons.</p>

<p>The state of this alternate reality is made manifest to us through our senses, and there arises an overlaying of this input with our mental models and their predictions. There are a variety of outcomes to this.</p>

<p>If what our models predict we will sense matches up with what we have sensed then the reward of having crafted a cloud castle that has been successfully mediated into the world outside hits. We <em>feel</em>. This is an experience of development. One of the primary ones which keeps us coming back for more.</p>

<p>But when the match fails, signaling that our mental-model hypothesis has been falsified‚Äìan all-too frequent occurrence in my experience‚Äìwe react to this disparity, this ‚Äúsurprise‚Äù, in one of several ways. This too is the root of experiences of development.</p>

<p>The type of reaction which arises depends upon our confidence in which of the two should carry more weight. Do we trust what we expect? Or do we trust what we sense? Most importantly for our purposes here, how do we explain the discrepancies away? Let us enumerate the coping strategies here<label for="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">I have tried to arrange these in order of magnitude, but clearly such an effort is very subjective. </span>, for I propose that it is within these responses, conscious or unconscious, that many of the varieties of development experience lie.</p>

<p>Firstly<label for="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">And most mundanely. </span>, we can doubt that we effectively mediated our mental models to the outside world, to the code. Did we make a typo? Did we forget a setting? Did we press the wrong button?</p>

<p>Secondly we can <em>maintain</em> our belief in the CREATION_SOLUTION mental-model we mentally constructed, but doubt that it is either a) a valid fit for the-thing-we-are-trying-to-make-slash-the-problem-we-are-trying-to-solve, or b) encodeable in our chosen language.  Is our mental-model valid, but unsuitable for this situation?</p>

<p>Thirdly we can doubt<label for="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">‚ÄúDoubt‚Äù could just as easily be replaced with the word ‚Äúquestion‚Äù, or with ‚Äúbecome confused about‚Äù. The only differences are in how conscious we are of this feeling. ‚ÄúDoubt‚Äù will do for now. </span> the integrity of the thing we constructed in our heads: the CREATION_SOLUTION mental-model<label for="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">See my previous post, for the classifications and naming I introduced in this area. </span>, assembled in our quest to make / solve. Did we make an error in our mental-model construction as it pertains to our situation?</p>

<p>Fourthly we can doubt our SUBSTRATE mental models - the ones representing our languages, libraries/frameworks and tool chain. Here we likely go back to the documentation, and update one or more of these SUBSTRATE mental models as a consequence. Do we misunderstand the tools we are working with?</p>

<p>Finally we can doubt what we are experiencing, and act as if it‚Äôs not happening. This can directly lead to us being blind to things, not seeing them when they are there, because to ‚Äúsee‚Äù is to understand, even in a most basic way.</p>

<p>[REDRAFT THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH]
How frequently this mis-match occurs is clearly important. But what strikes me as more worthy of investigation is how different people, at different times, and in different contexts experience, and consequently (re)act / respond, both intellectually and emotionally to all these outcomes, both predicted, and surprising.</p>

<p>But there is one more aspect I want to bring to the table. The experience of the wholly-internal castle construction.  ‚Ä¶..</p>

<p>The detail, granularity, and explicit-ness [SURELY THERE IS A BETTER WORD?] of our mental models is also highly significant. We are alo limited by how much we can ‚Äúhold in our heads‚Äù [ALTHOUGH THE AMOUNTS VARY GREATLY FROM PERSON TO PERSON]. Admittedly, we do not need to hold all details as we have committed it to the screen [SCREEN? THERE IS AN ALMOST-IMMEDIATE  RE-READING ASPECT HERE] but that does not mean we don‚Äôt need to be able to add to it, change it, improve it, and build on top of it.</p>

<p>Now we move to pleasure and confidence. [I‚Äôm NOT SURE WE DO.]</p>

<p>To joy.</p>

<p>To satisfaction.</p>

<p>[IF I WAS TO DESCRIBE MY EXPERIENCE OF DEVELOPMENT IN THREE WORDS I WOULD CHOOSE ‚ÄúCREATIVE‚Äù, ‚ÄúSATISFYING‚Äù  AND ‚ÄúFRUSTRATING‚Äù].</p>

<p>In coding [‚ÄúDEVELOPMENT‚Äù, OR ‚ÄúMAKING CODE-THINGS‚Äù?] we are engaged heavily in tool-use. Tools which are complex, multi-faceted, nuanced, and which must gel [‚ÄúGEL‚Äù DOESN‚ÄôT FEEL LIKE IT LINKS STRONGLY ENOUGH BACK TO WHAT WENT IN THE FIRST SECTION] with our wider expectations [BUT ‚ÄúEXPECTATIONS‚Äù DOES, SO PERHAPS‚Ä¶ü§î] of what they are, how they are structured, and how they work.</p>

<p>As we become more familiar with a language, it‚Äôs associated mental model/philosophy, and it‚Äôs associated [REPEATS ‚ÄúASSOCIATED‚Äù]  libraries, frameworks and tooling we see not only how it succeeds, but how it fails; we see it‚Äôs limitations and shortcomings.</p>

<p>[WOULD THE VIRGINIA WOOLF QUOTES FIT IN HERE?]</p>

<p>[IT FEELS WE LEAP FROM WRITING TO READING HERE. AND FROM ‚Ä¶ ]</p>

<p>The perception of these things is different for different people. Their mental models of the language may vary greatly in their ‚Äúbit depth‚Äù. [REFER OUT TO CATHY SIERRA.] So too may be someone‚Äôs comfort with the issues [AND SHORTCOMINGS?] which a language or associated ecosystem might throw up [NOT SURE I LIKE THIS IMAGE - ü§¢ ‚ÄúPRESENT‚Äù?].</p>

<p>There is also the fact of someone‚Äôs comfort with a language‚Äôs syntax (or even style) [N.B. IN DEVS THIS IS ALSO VERY PECULIARLY FLOWS OUT TO THE PHYSICAL ENV - CODE-COLOUR, KEYBOARD, LIGHTING, ETC ALL CAN PLAY A ROLE HERE] and the ease with which they can consume this and conjoure up [I LIKE THIS PHRASE. BUILD IN MORE SKY-CASTLES LIKE THIS?] the associated mental model from it.</p>

<p>In this there is a strong association with how much detail can be represented as a ‚Äúshort-hand‚Äù and therefore manipulated effectively and effortlessly with confidence and skill. [THERE IS A MENTAL-EFFORT SIDE-BAR / DIGRESSION IN HERE TO PULL OUT.]</p>

<p>But we have not spoken of joy. The joy must come in great part from mastery, [WHAT ABOUT AUTONOMY AND PURPOSE? DO I EVEN WANT TO USE THIS WORD WITH ALL THE DISTRACTING CONNOTATIONS IT WILL BRING?] and the development of the same. But it can also come from both a lack of friction [MENTAL EFFORT AGAIN] and deployment [‚ÄúMANIPULATION‚Äù / ‚ÄúDEFEAT‚Äù / ‚ÄúSUBDUGATION‚Äù?] of vast [VAST? REALLY?] complexity with little [‚ÄúLITTLE‚Äù? HOW ABOUT ‚ÄúAPPROPRIATE‚Äù? OR SOMETHING ELSE. THIS NEEDS TO BE UNPACKED TOO] mental effort.</p>

<p>There is also the potential joy in experiencing the pleasant surprise when something built from simple elements combines as hoped [‚ÄúEXPECTED‚Äù? ‚ÄúHOPED‚Äù IS NICE HERE AS IT HAS THE ELEMENT OF FAITH IN IT‚Ä¶] (i.e. without a great deal of solid confidence) and works as planned, revealing a greater power [‚ÄúPOWER‚Äù? AGAIN THIS IS QUITE OVER-BLOWN] than had been imagined. [‚ÄúTHOUGHT POSSIBLE‚Äù?]</p>

<p>[<strong>**CHECK THE JOYS BELOW AREN‚ÄôT ACTUALLY COVERED LATER ON</strong>**]</p>

<p>[THERE IS ALSO THE JOY OF HAVING USED ONE‚ÄôS TOOLS EFFECTIVELY. MENTAL AND PHYSICAL. TO HAVE HAD THE RIGHT THINGS TO HAND TO HAVE APPROACHED IT ALL IN THE BEST WAY. TO HAVE FELT THE EXCITEMENT OF ALL THE PIECES OF THE MENTAL AND PHYSICAL PROCESSES WORKING TOGETHER AS ONE. ¬´¬´&lt; TDD COMES INTO THIS.]</p>

<p>[THERE IS ALSO HERE THE JOY OF A PROBLEM UNDERSTOOD AND BESTED, ]</p>

<p>[AND BEYOND THIS, THERE IS THE JOY FELT IN PRIDE OF CRAFTSMANSHIP - FIND ANOTHER WORD GIVEN THE CONNOTATIONS OF THIS ONE; OF A TIDY, JUST-ENOUGH SOLUTION.]</p>

<p>[AND THERE IS ALSO THE JOY IN AND OF A JOB COMPLETED. OF NEVER HAVING TO GO BACK SOMEWHERE. OF HAVING CONQUERED FRUSTRATION.]</p>

<p>[AND THE JOY OF HAVING LEARNED. OF HAVING UPDATED A MENTAL MODEL.]</p>

<p>How much of this is consious? It is not wholly correleated with mastery. [THERE‚ÄôS THAT WORD AGAIN] You can consciously be struggling with something and be aware at [‚ÄúOF‚Äù?] the lack of strength of depth of mismatch in mental models. [KEEP BRINGING IT BACK TO THE MENTAL MODELS.]</p>

<p>And this brings in [‚ÄúBRINGS IN‚Äù SUCKS AS ENGLISH] another joy, in the construction of a new set of mental models and experiences in using them. In the experiencing of what is easier and harder, possible and impossible, in this new mindset. In the surprise at failing, and the surprise at learning. In the surprise in contrast between a solid, comfortable, established model and a new, unfamiliar, effervescent one. [AND THE JOY OF HAVING CAUGHT AND PINNED-DOWN/EXPRESSED THE LATTER.]</p>

<p>What about different modes of thinking? Both the ‚ÄúHappy Path‚Äù [CALL OUT TO BRUCE AND JAMES HERE] and the other paths? What about mode-swapping, both within a stack (e.g. from core language, to libraries, to framework, to tooling, etc.) and outwith (e.g. databases, etc.) Is there joy in these changes, in deploying multiple tools [AND ASSOCIATED MENTAL MODELS] to solve an overall problem? [DON‚ÄôT LOSE THE THING-PROBLEM HERE. I‚ÄôM LEAKING MY ANTI-DB BIAS HERE] Is there joy in staying in one place? [ONE HEAD-SPACE?] Is there joy in being challenged and overcoming complexity, and is there joy in understanding how it worked, and then finally distilling it down to the simplest, most elegant, most intentional and explicit solution?  [LINK IN THE THREE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES OF TDD HERE TO.]</p>

<p>[IT FEELS LIKE THIS COULD GO RIGHT UP AT THE TOP - OR PERHAPS WHEN WE START GETTING TO TOIL/FRICTION/EFFORT.]
(Programming) Languages are built to provide abstractions. Sometimes they are more explicit than others. Sometimes they are more consistent than others. Sometimes they are more complete than others. Sometimes they are high level, other times they are low level. [SOMETIMES THEY ARE BOTH, EITHER CONSISTENTLY OR INCONSISTENTLY.] Sometimes they [AND THEIR ECOSYSTEMS] are fitted to [THE ENTIRETY OF] our task perfectly. Other times they are not - being incomplete, or having [‚ÄúCAUSING‚Äù?] friction with our mental-solution model [IS THIS MY NAME FOR THE OTHER MODEL?] (Is it easier when we think in their model? ‚ÄúThinking in Java‚Äù for example‚Ä¶)</p>

<p>[LANGUAGES WHICH FIT:]
‚ÄúTo begin with, there is the technical difficulty [‚Ä¶] that the very form of the sentence does not fit her. It is a sentence made by men; it is too loose, to heavy, too pompous for a woman‚Äôs use.‚Äù 
from the essay ‚ÄúWomen and Fiction‚Äù by Virginia Woolf</p>

<p>‚ÄúAnd this a woman must make for herself, altering and adapting the current sentence until she writes one that takes the natural shape of her thought without crushing or distorting it.‚Äù
from the essay ‚ÄúWomen and Fiction‚Äù by Virginia Woolf (bold mine)</p>

<p>How much do we think of the mental models in the minds of others? How much do we care to express what is in our heads clearly, consistently and explicitly? How much do we think about reading again the code we have just output [THIS IS A HEAVY WORD, BUT I LIKE IT HERE] just now in order to get something to work?</p>

<p>[CONSIDER WHY I WANT TO QUOTE FROM WRITERS (AND OTHER ARTISTS?)]</p>

<p>[ANOTHER THOUGHT FOR EARLIER ON?]
How too does this play into Bruce‚Äôs ongoing question about control? Do we prefer to be falsely unsurprised or truthfully [?] (and frequently) surprised (and disappointed). IS THIS WHY SO MANY HATE TO EXPERIENCE THEIR CODE RUNNING AS IT WILL SHATTER THEIR ILLUSIONS?</p>

<p>[ALSO: WHAT ABOUT SYSTEM METAPHOR?]</p>
