<p>(This post is second in a series.  Part one, “<a href="/2021/03/26/is-your-organisation-broken">Is Your Organisation Broken?</a>” sets the scene for this post’s proposal of a new way to look at organisations.)</p>

<p><span class="newthought">I’ve wondered for a long time </span> if there’s value in considering organisations from the perspective of the services they provide to their members.</p>

<p>Now, I propose that how any individual organisation provides such services varies greatly, but I think (bear with me) that the following is an exhaustive list of services that all organisations provide.  Clearly then, sometimes an organisation will provide one or more of these services explicitly, and other times it will provide some of them implicitly (or even by accident).  Furthermore, some services will be provided officially, and others unofficially. Sometimes both types will be at play at once, one most likely working more efficiently than another.</p>

<p>Finally, please note that this breakdown says nothing about the quality or fit of any of the service implementations in a given organisation.  The services as delivered might be terrible, or they might be excellent.  They might conflict with or contradict one another.</p>

<p>With this in mind we can get to the services themselves.  I am no org-design expert (I’ve just read a lot, and consulted in a lot of places, and like to nerd-out and find how other folks organisations work) but I <em>hope</em> that the items on this list are both collectively exhaustive and mutually exclusive.  Finally I’ve tried to put them in order of importance.  It is likely that in <em>all</em> organisations the first two services are explicit. Only in larger organisations might later / all other services be so.</p>

<p>I’ve tried to use a service-design style way of representing this which names the service, gives the need it meets, the outcome it provides, and the value it delivers.<br /><br /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>That’s it for now. In my following posts I want to look at various organisations and organisational styles and see how these services might map onto them.</p>

<!--Joe Schrag: It might be interesting to think around which are directly important to the members and which are a byproduct of the org.  For example, for the individual,  the need for community is huge, especially with shared purpose.  To need others and to be needed.  To be a contributor to the tribe.  Seems like that could be 1 + 6 (skills + constitution).  On the other hand, I would argue 5 (coordination) is not directly as important to the individual, but needed in an org.
It might be helpful to think of them in a hierarchy as well.  A lot in common here with Maslow’s hierarchy.
Perhaps also worth noting that specific versions of some of these needs can lead to less desirable results.  The one the comes to mind is conquest (perhaps part of 3).  Some individuals have a need for it, and many orgs prioritize it. -->
