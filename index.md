{% newthought "Hello and welcome to" %} my blog-aggregator. If you're looking for my algebra blog which used to live here, [it's not gone far](index-algebra.html).

Over the years I've been a little profligate with my internet prescence. Here's a handy overview, with some deep links into the semi-interesting bits.

There are three sections: Speaking, Open Source, and Blogging.  You can also find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/al94781) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewharmellaw).

# Speaking
I've been lucky enough to talk at a bunch of UK and international conferences. My main talks have been as follows:

[Combatting the Near Enemies of Domain Driven Design - at Scale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CFyA4iecng) (DDD Europe in Amsterdam, O'Reilly Architecture Conference in Berlin and DDD eXchange in London, 2018-19)

[Organisation Refactoring and Culture Hacking - Lessons from Software](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jqPxGShb90) (Voxxed Days in Banff, Devoxx London and Belgium, and JFokus Stockholm, 2018-19)

[Distributed Architecture and Design: A Scientific Approach](https://vimeo.com/181781920) (JavaZone 2017 with Kevin Rudland)

[Harnessing Domain-Driven Design for Distributed Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5tFNT55kmM) (Devoxx UK 2016 with Gayathri Thiyagarajan)

[Bootstrapping a Scala Mindset](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/5835-bootstrapping-a-scala-mindset) (Scala eXchange London 2014)

[5 Whys: Counter-Intuitive Solutions to (all too Common) Problems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znQtAIpXlP4) (Devoxx UK 2014)

# Open Source
I never get as much time as I'd like to work on open source, but I've been lucky to have been around for some cool moments.

I was there at the founding of the [Jenkins JobDSL](https://plugins.jenkins.io/job-dsl/) (which is still in Jenkins core and - I'm told - partially inspired the Jenkinsfile we have today).

I also started the [archaius-spring-adapter](https://github.com/andrewharmellaw/archaius-spring-adapter), created the open source [Capgemini Grade Ladder](https://github.com/Capgemini/grade-ladder), and contributed [some documentation improvements](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/issues/3098) for the Pony language.

Sadly my most-starred repo is 100% based on the work of others - an [ascii-doc-ification](https://github.com/andrewharmellaw/wardley-maps-book) of [Simon Wardley's](https://twitter.co/swardley) Wardley Mapping blog posts.

# Blogging
## Thoughtworks
So far, I've only written one post for the ThoughtWorks Insights blog: "[Domain-driven design needn't be hard. Here's how to start](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/domain-driven-design-neednt-be-hard-heres-how-start)".

## Capgemini
At my previous employer, I and a [co-conspirator](https://twitter.com/tsphethean) set up the [Capgemini engineering blog](https://capgemini.github.io/).  

Some of my posts include, "[How we work](https://capgemini.github.io/development/how-we-work/)" (co-authored with Malcom Young), "[Why microservices are right for us](https://capgemini.github.io/architecture/why-microservices-are-right-for-us-pt1)", "[Microservices - a reality check(point)](https://capgemini.github.io/architecture/microservices-reality-check/)", "[When it's clever to admit that you're not feeling clever](https://capgemini.github.io/development/its-sometimes-clever-to-admit/)", and 
"[Last year an unconference changed my life](https://capgemini.github.io/learning/last-year-an-unconf/)".

I also wrote the [response from the Capgemini UK Engineering team to the James Damore Anti-Diversity Manifesto](https://capgemini.github.io/engineering/Capgemini-Engineering-Diversity-Manifesto/).

## Learning Algebra
Hidden behind this landing page is [the math blog](index-algebra.html) I wrote as I worked my way through [Gelfand's "Algebra"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2140100.Algebra).

## Learning new Programming Languages
As with algebra so with programming languages. I blogged as I learned [Scala](https://scalaeyeforthejavaguy.blogspot.com/), and [Ruby](https://rubyeyeforthejavaguy.blogspot.com/), and managed fitful attempts as I picked up [Go](https://grokkinggolang.github.io/).

## Medium
I also flirted with a Medium blog for a while. The two best posts are "[Warhammer fantasy career planning](https://medium.com/@andrewharmellaw/warhammer-fantasy-career-planning-405b3b6f0d6a)" and "[Yet another post on work-life balance](https://medium.com/@andrewharmellaw/yet-another-post-on-work-life-balance-dc69781ed732)"

## Blogger
I started (and found my feet) blogging on one of the original platforms - blogger - where the title of [my blog](https://the-music-of-time.blogspot.com/) is the best thing about it.
