{% newthought "Andrew Harmel-Law is" %} a [Tech Principal at Thoughtworks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-cn/profiles/a/andrew-harmel-law0) as well as an author and online trainer for [O'Reilly](https://www.oreilly.com/pub/au/8117), Andrew specialises in Java / JVM technologies, agile delivery, build tools and automation, and domain driven design. 

Experienced across the software development lifecycle and in many sectors what motivates him is the efficient delivery of large-scale software solutions, fulfilling complex user needs. He understands that people, architecture, process and tooling all have key roles to play in achieving this. Andrew has a passion for open source software and its communities. He has been involved with OSS to a greater or lesser extent since his career began; as a user, contributor, expert group member, or paid advocate - most famously as one of the [Jenkins JobDSL](https://github.com/jenkinsci/job-dsl-plugin/) originators. 

Andrew enjoys sharing his experience as much as possible. This sharing is not only seen in his formal consulting engagements, but also informally through mentoring, books, online training, blog posts, conferences (speaking and organising), and open-sourcing his code.  His next book "Facilitating Software Architecture" is making its way onto the internet, a chapter at a time.

# Things I made
Over the years I've been a little profligate with my internet prescence. Here's a handy overview, with some deep links into the semi-interesting bits.

If I was to sum up everything that I have collected here it would "a series of attempts at [unflattening](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23503006-unflattening)". That is to say I'm trying to reconsider how I, and others, construct knowledge, and challenge when I think things could be different.

Beginning with my first conference talk at [Devoxx UK in 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znQtAIpXlP4), right up to my current blog series on the [experience of development](index-xp-of-dev.html) and [organisations](index-orgs.html) I've been trying to understand why things are they way they are; to bring different perspectives; and ask challenging questions.  

Sometimes this involves pointing out what I think we've forgotten. Other times it's to suggest parallels and contrasts with other disciplines.  Other times still I'm just trying to figure stuff out and wanted to share my progress.

There are three sections to all this, based on the medium of my musings: Training, Speaking / Panels, Open Source, and Blogging.  You can also find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/al94781) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewharmellaw).

If you're looking for my algebra blog which used to live here, [it's not gone far](index-algebra.html).

## Training
I was fortunate to be asked to write a course for the O'Reilly online training Platform. The result is the following:

* a three-hour, hands-on extravaganza is titled [Domain-Driven Design: First Steps](https://learning.oreilly.com/live-training/courses/domain-driven-design-first-steps/0636920051628/) and runs every 2 months or so.
* another three-hour chat-fest titled [Architecture Decision Making by Example](https://learning.oreilly.com/live-events/architecture-decision-making-by-example/0636920080767/0636920080766/). This also runs every 2 months or so.

[Simple steps to adopt DDD](https://twitter.com/al94781/status/1176152449226334209)

### Capgemini
At my previous employer, I and a [co-conspirator](https://twitter.com/tsphethean) set up the [Capgemini engineering blog](https://capgemini.github.io/).  

Some of my posts include, "[How we work](https://capgemini.github.io/development/how-we-work/)" (co-authored with Malcom Young), "[Why microservices are right for us](https://capgemini.github.io/architecture/why-microservices-are-right-for-us-pt1)", "[Microservices - a reality check(point)](https://capgemini.github.io/architecture/microservices-reality-check/)", "[When it's clever to admit that you're not feeling clever](https://capgemini.github.io/development/its-sometimes-clever-to-admit/)", and 
"[Last year an unconference changed my life](https://capgemini.github.io/learning/last-year-an-unconf/)".

I also wrote the [response from the Capgemini UK Engineering team to the James Damore Anti-Diversity Manifesto](https://capgemini.github.io/engineering/Capgemini-Engineering-Diversity-Manifesto/).

### Learning Algebra
Hidden behind this landing page is [the math blog](index-algebra.html) I wrote as I worked my way through [Gelfand's "Algebra"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2140100.Algebra).

### Learning new Programming Languages
As with algebra so with programming languages. I blogged as I learned [Scala](https://scalaeyeforthejavaguy.blogspot.com/), and [Ruby](https://rubyeyeforthejavaguy.blogspot.com/), and managed fitful attempts as I picked up [Go](https://grokkinggolang.github.io/).

### Medium
I also flirted with a Medium blog for a while. The two best posts are "[Warhammer fantasy career planning](https://medium.com/@andrewharmellaw/warhammer-fantasy-career-planning-405b3b6f0d6a)" and "[Yet another post on work-life balance](https://medium.com/@andrewharmellaw/yet-another-post-on-work-life-balance-dc69781ed732)"

### Blogger
I started (and found my feet) blogging on one of the original platforms - blogger - where the title of [my blog](https://the-music-of-time.blogspot.com/) is the best thing about it.

## Open Source
I never get as much time as I'd like to work on open source, but I've been lucky to have been around for some cool moments.

I was there at the founding of the [Jenkins JobDSL](https://plugins.jenkins.io/job-dsl/) (which is still in Jenkins core and - I'm told - partially inspired the Jenkinsfile we have today).

I also started the [archaius-spring-adapter](https://github.com/andrewharmellaw/archaius-spring-adapter), created the open source [Capgemini Grade Ladder](https://github.com/Capgemini/grade-ladder), and contributed [some documentation improvements](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/issues/3098) for the Pony language.

Sadly my most-starred repo is 100% based on the work of others - an [ascii-doc-ification](https://github.com/andrewharmellaw/wardley-maps-book) of [Simon Wardley's](https://twitter.co/swardley) Wardley Mapping blog posts.
