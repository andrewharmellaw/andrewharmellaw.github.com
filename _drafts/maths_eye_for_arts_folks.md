With the resurgence in the topic of Machine Learning (and a conversation I had in an airport departure lounge) I wanted to get back to one of the main topics of my degree.  

I was shocked to learn that it had become increasingly maths based.  I'd topped out on maths at Higher-level (age?) but if I wanted to get back into it this topic, and bolster myself in many others (It was by thius point inevitable - I'd also been stalking Functional Programming for years) then I'd need to take the plunge.

I realise now, having been back into it for about 6 months, that there were two things I needed.  I needed to find my "bottom" (the point where I last really grokked maths) and also learn how to learn.  Most things I do are solidly in areas where the answers come easily and natually - I am a visual thinker, so OO programming for me comes natuarlly, as does domain modelling and architecure.  Not so mathematis.

I have found two points to help me: Gelfands Algebra, and A Mind for Numbers (by Oakley).  I now propose to start blogging my way (as I have in the past) as I bootstrap myself back up.  What I post will be personal, but I believe it may also be useful - it will be in areas I personally found lacking as I've done this learning (I've felt is in other ways in my learning journey too).  In this respect I hope it will help others.

What I wanted to discover was where the mind for the conceptual jumps comes from, and whtehre I could find that mind within myself.  Could I solve maths puzzles like they do in the books?

* Realisations
  * You need to be careful when you apply the techniques, else all is lost
  * Things percolate down to natural bottoms
  * but you can push them back up hill if you need to (but this is MUCH harder work / impossible?)
  * Conventions apply, and there are secret passageways between many of them, as this is how patterns are articulated
  * you can prove things, by getting from your current state to a known proof (which is already proven)
  * you will end up with lots of numbers and symbols, but if you can also remember what these represent (i.e. conceptually) - probably by means of chunking - then you will be able to manipulate everything and then it's just careful application of the techniques

* Mental toolbox
  * methods to use (long division, multiplying fractions, etc.)
  * techniques to employ - explode powers out (e.g. 3^3 -> 3.3.3)
  * patterns to spot - e.g. "square of the sum" formula
  * tricks to try - "graph it / whats the line?"
  * things to remember (odd and even, zero/less than zero/more than zero, mult. by negative number)
* Note difference in text between "2" and "two".  Note also the symbology "=>" (aka "therefore"?)
