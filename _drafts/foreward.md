I wrote this book because I wanted to learn mathematics.  

![Purity from XKCD](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/purity.png){:class="img-responsive"}

Mathematics is something I am not incompetent at (I have a Science degree, and it came up every now and then in Statistics class, etc. etc.) but it's also something which I never felt I truly, deeply understood.  Yet, Mathematics is fundamental to what I do for a profession (I'm a Software Engineer - and aspire to both understand what is happening in the rapidly-rising and interconnected fields of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Deep Learning, and also to read [Knuth's Concrete Mathematics](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/112243.Concrete_Mathematics)) and essential if I am to be one hundered percent productive in functional langauges such as [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) and [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/). I feel like I'm missing out on the full picture without it.{% sidenote 'sn-id-whatever' "Oh, and it's also something my kids are going to start asking me about very soon.  Dad-panic." %}

I had a problem however because, despite the fact I knew I needed to get somewhere, but I didn't actually know what that place was called, and neither did I know where I was when I started, or how to get to my destination.

To resolve this I decided to just pick anywhere on the mathematics map that looked vaguely familiar, drop myself in, and feel my way from there.

Unsurprisingly it didnt go well to begin with, but each time I tried to do some learning and failed I found out more about where I was, and what I didn't know. And by this uncovering of  what I needed to know, I slowly worked my way backwards and found my firm foundations.

It turned out that these foundations were pretty insubstantial.  But they were solid, and from them I could begin to build.

As I built, I discovered that the best way for me to personally learn was to blog my progress.  After a while I began to flatter myself into thinking that collected, and re-jigged a little, these blogs might make a handy book.  Why? Being based heavily on a single core text, a set of solutions to that text, and a meta-text on learning approaches, there is little new here.  Not only this, but is is abundantly clear that not only are there many books on mathematics, but reading them alone will not make you a mathematician.

No, what I noticed was that there were no books out there which described, examined and discussed the _experience of learning mathematics_ from the very fundamentals upwards.  Neither was there any book which told some simple truths, and admitted to it all feeling, at times, a little bit magical.  That then was may gap in the market.  I decided to pull it together and "publish".

If you are reading this then I hope it is as worth your time as it has been for me to write it.  If you are interested in writing something of your own in the area of mathematics, there are a few technical hoops to jump through which I've learned along the way and you can find details about in the appendices.
