## The First Patterns
You may not have heard of “A Pattern Language” by Alexander et al. It’s pretty old, looks even older, is very thick, and concerns building and buildings.  But if you work in software development then you will definitely have felt its influence, because it’s offspring are everywhere.

Published in 1977, this book collated two hundred and fifty three “patterns”, each of which defined, discussed, and then resolved a recurring and fundamental problem seen in either towns, buildings, or construction. 

The authors tell us: 

> _Each solution [...] gives the essential field of relationships needed to solve the problem, but in a very general and abstract way—so you can solve the problem, in your way, by adapting it to your preferences, and the local conditions at the place you are making it._ C. Alexander et al, _"A Pattern Language", pp. xiii'_

Each individual pattern achieves this in the same structured way; using words, with supporting drawings, photographs and charts. It’s instructive to take a look at one of the patterns to get an idea of what they’re like. A great example is pattern number 159 “Light on Two Sides of Every Room”. 

But in software we’re always being told “software architecture has nothing to do with physical architecture” aren't we? If we don’t have “real” architects, why should we care about this ancient book from an entirely unrelated field?

We should care because Alexander et al’s “patterns” concept became more popular in the world of software than anywhere else.
