Section 33 of [Gelfand's Algebra]() introduces the _incredibly_ simple concept of Rational Expressions.  These are in effect a super-set of polynomials, created by _slightly_ relaxing the rules of what makes a polynomial a polynomial and allowing in division.

Did I say "Incredibly simple"? How could I possibly be mistaken? 

## The Subtleties of Division
In [coming back to all this algebra]() a few fundamental misconceptions from my early maths history have been challenged.  Amongst these is the mistaken belief that multiplication and division were two sides of the same coin in the same way that addition and subtraction actually are.  What I'd failed to grasp was that whereas in the latter movement in position of terms _was_ always possible in my simple world-view (it's the Commutative Law, in it's addition-form) 

$$ a + b = b + a $$

$$ a - b = -b + a $$

but the same could not be said for the former (the Commutative Law applies to multiplication but _not_ division remember).

$$ 2 * 3 = 3 * 2 $$

$$ 2 / 3 \ne 3 / 2$$

Oh, and while we're at it, there's also the problem of zero.

$$ 0 / 3 = 0 $$

$$ 3/0 = ...$$

Boom! basically (until we get on to infinity which is another post, perhaps when I get back to [Turing]() and [Petzold]()).
