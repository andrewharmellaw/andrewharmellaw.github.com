This post is a quick one.  There is a set of terminology which comes up occasionally across Mathematics - I encountered them most recently in Petzold's excellent "Annotated Turing", in the section when he's discussion Hillberg's work.  

I found it useful to lay them out in order to clear up the picture in my head of their interrelation.

* Symbol - e.g. "$=$", "$\ne$"
* Axiom (aka Postulate) - if an Axiomatic system is "complete" then than means it can be used to derive all _true_ Formulas. This derivation is done using Proofs. - e.g. "All right angles are equal to one another"
* Rule - e.g. dictates how a theorem can be constructed from Axioms - e.g. 
* Proof (aka Theorem) - application of the Axioms and the Rules - e.g. ...
* (Well Formed) Formula (aka "wff" or "woof") - Forumlas _can_ just be assembled by using the Symbols, but they are "true" when derived from Axioms and/or validated using Rules in a Proof - e.g. gobbledygook $=$ yadayadayada
* Conjecture - an unproven (i.e. it has no proof) WFF - e.g. ...
