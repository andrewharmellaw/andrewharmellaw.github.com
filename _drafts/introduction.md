## The Open Road

> "There is no royal road to Mathematics". (after [Euclid, speaking to Ptolemy I](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Euclid))

{% newthought "This book is a companion." %} It is also a record, and a side-effect.

Learning mathematics is hard.  It is hard for many many reasons, but primarily amongst these is the fact that it is in many ways pure thought-work.  Mathematics is fundamental, abstract, non-intuitive, and circular. It is both paradoxical and contradictory.  Worst of all, mathematics is build on top of mathematics which is built atop even more mathematics.  It is a structure, which, if the foundations are not solid, then nothing built on top of them will have any pratical utility.

And yet mathematics is also beautiful.  It is exciting, fulfilling, and simple. It has an enthralling and labyrinthine history

Consequently mathematics isn't for the faint-hearted. It isn't for the time-poor, or for those in a hurry.  

## Where are we Headed?
This book aims to help you make your first few steps on your mathematics journey. But simply reading the following pages alone won't do the trick - that will not teach you mathematics.  That's like listening to someone else's story and expecting to consequently have the experiences and reap the same benefits as those who actually went on the ride.  However it is a good place to start, in part by acting as a de-mystifier.  In this it might help you on your way, if you use it as a guide, or a companion.  

Hopefully it will at least make clear to you a range of facts to which no-one else seems willing to admit: The fact that there typically many ways of solving these problems but that we just learn a single one because of tradition or history. The fact that a great deal of Mathematics is the spotting of patterns, and the application of a standard set of tricks and recipies to these patterns to get your elements into a state where you can draw some conclusion. The fact that some aspects of mathematics aren't fact, they're just convention. The fact that some of this is hard - really hard - despite the pure simplicity of so much of it, and that some of the greatest minds found it difficult too.  The fact that much of it is the non-thinking application of detailed but mechanical steps, simply trying to make sure you don't make an error.  The fact that the syntax of Mathematics, with it's reliquary arcane symbols and ways of setting things out is sometimes a barrier to mastery rather than an aid. The fact that there seems to be a predisposition towards the terse and formal over the verbose and chatty in much writing in this area. The fact that lots of this just gets easier and more familiar with practice; lots and lots of practice.  The fact that there is as much intuition{% sidenote 'sn-id-whatever' "Dare I say luck?" %} at play as there is intellectual thought-graft.

Just as there is no "Royal Road" to Mathematics; neither is there a single one. There are many. This book came about as I forged my own path through the foothills (I'm still there). I produced it as a personal record of my journey, and also an exercise to embed what I had learned.  Perhaps the biggest lesson this will give you is to follow it's example, and if it does, that's great.{% sidenote 'sn-id-whatever' "There are notes on how to do this in the Appendixes." %}

## Three Sources
This first volume is written on the back of three other source texts.  It could in some respects be considered a glorified gloss. Without them it is nothing.  This book's journey is in reality their journey.  Without them it is useless.  Please feel free to read this without having them close to hand, but if you intend to undertake the journey yourself, you should go and buy them. 

First comes the core text - I. M. Gelfand and A. Shen's "[Algebra](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Algebra-I-M-Gelfand/dp/0817636773/)" which I refer to from here on in simply as "Gelfand". It is the first in a series of books{% sidenote 'sn-id-whatever' "And correspondance course at Rutgers University." %} intended for those at "secondary school level."  Don't let that fool you.  I have it on good authority that many of the topics covered will stretch you up to undergraduate topics.  So why this book? Because it is a phenomenally well-structured journey through the concepts of algebra as well as tiny elements of geometry.  It is a hard journey however; you are expected to pay close attention and do a vast majority of the work.

Second there is Barbara Oakley's "[A Mind For Numbers](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mind-Numbers-Science-Flunked-Algebra-ebook/dp/B00G3L19ZU)". Some might argue that this light read is an optional companion on your journey; yet I credit it with the perspective, concepts, and methodologies essential for building solidly, concept upon concept.  As a Psychology Major, some of the "science" is pretty hokey, but don't let that get in the way.  Put it to one side if it offends you, but please do have a look and see what you want to take.  Even if it's her permisson to "read ahead".  For me, that alone was an invaluable tip.

Third there are Adrian S. Durham's "[Solutions to the Unsolved Problems in Gelfand's Algebra](https://www.dropbox.com/s/73tlsu23gjo7vjo/Gelfand%20Algebra%20Solutions.pdf?dl=0)".  These are less terse than Gelfand, but still require you to pay attention.  

Taken as a collective, they are what sit behind everything that follows in this volume.  Gelfand forms the spine - we will work it through, problem by problem, calling out to Durham as and when required.  Oakley is called upon as needed, and thanked as required.  She is the inspiration for some of the more prosaic paragraphs, having implicitly given her permission to explicitly describe and discuss the mental experiences of the journey. She is also the source of the key concept of "chunks".  If Gelfand is the direction of travel, Oakley's chunks inform the size and shape of the steps.  This is more than a mere pedagogical construct, helping to delineate chapters and sections; they are the units of thought-currency which must be grasped, encoded and manipulated if you are to stand any chance of arriving at your destination.{% sidenote 'sn-id-whatever' "Which is not to say that all will be hard-fought.  Perhaps you are one of the lucky ones for whom all this comes easily, with concept after concept seeming self-evident and graspable from the moment it is introduced.  I wish I was so blessed." %}

##Â The Journey

!!!!!!!!CONFIDENCE!!!!!!!

I have learned in the course of writing that having a visual representation of even wholly abstract concepts makes them far easier to process.  I know well that one thing I've frequently wished for is a map of the key mental stages of a journey before I've even taken a single step.

Consequently, I've retrospectively pulled together the following. (Fig 1.)

[Route map here - Fig 1]

## The Sights
As you progress along your way you will encounter many things beyond these key milestones. So that they are easier to identify, consume and digest I have tried to list the core types.

You will first be conscious of the _problems_.  These are called out explicitly bhy number. The entirety of Gelfand (and by extension Durham) is driven by them, and they are fundamental to the action of Oakley's method.  They will most likely torment you, but when you defeat them you will be glad of them.

Next are the _chunks_ themselves, signified most explicitly in the structure of this book - they are what I use instead of chapters. These are not in Gelfand, having been imposed by me based on my experiences. Some are large, some are small.  Some correspond one-to-one to sections in Gelfand, others they are more numerous. The "chunks" are the same "chunks" that Oakley coined.  I strongly suggest that you use her method when forming them.

After that arises the _notation and terminology_.  Mathematics has been around a long time, and these will remind you of that fact every chance they get, as well as how unused to reading them you will initially be.  You will also discover that in mathematics, some words are used multiple times to mean multiple different things, and equally confusingly some things have more than one name.  These instances are called out explicitly and discussed. What is more, I frequently found it useful to investigate the history behind them because there is always a reason for these being as they are, and knowing aids chunking.

Alongside these are some core _concepts_ (e.g. "undefined", "infinity", and "irrational numbers") which are typically used when matters venture beyond the simple and straightforward.  These are indicated by the use of _italics_.

Luckily you will become familiar with manipulating and leveraging all these elements via the application of _algorithms_ (such as [Long Division](https://andrewharmellaw.github.io/2016/11/16/gelfands-algebra-chunk-1-fundamentals/) and [Polynomial Division](https://andrewharmellaw.github.io/2017/02/23/gelfands-algebra-chunk-14-polynomial-division-all-the-gory-details/)), _laws_ (such as the [Commutative, Associative and Distributive Laws](https://andrewharmellaw.github.io/2016/11/23/gelfands-algebra-chunk-2-commutative-associative-and-distributive-laws/)) and _theorems_ (such as [Bezout's Remainder Theorem](https://andrewharmellaw.github.io/2017/03/07/gelfands-algebra-chunk-16-polynomial-division-remainders/)).  These too are flagged by the use of _italics_.

But how do you know when to apply these tools? That comes when you learn to spot _patterns_ (such as the [Short Multiplication Formulas](https://andrewharmellaw.github.io/2016/12/17/gelfanfd-algebra-chunk-6-squares-sums-diffs-etc/) and various [Progressions](https://andrewharmellaw.github.io/2017/03/24/gelfands-algebra-chunk-23-embedding-progressions/)) and later, to apply _algebraic manipulations_ to make these patterns evident and applicable.  Yet again, _italics_ seemed to be a useful way to flag them.

Alongside this, in getting to these patterns you will learn more and more _tricks_.  I personally put great importance on these elements.  This is likely to be because they are the embodiment, for me, of the "magic" of mathematics, and the way that magicians get their results.  The intelligence comes in knowing which trick to use, and when.  These are grouped into sections named "Tricks Arising" whenever they arise. They are also all listed again and indexed in an appendix all of their own.

Penultimately there are standardisations in the form of various _conventions_ (e.g. [Negative Powers](https://andrewharmellaw.github.io/2016/12/10/gelfands-algebra-chunk-5-powers/) and the ["Standard Form" of Polynomials](https://andrewharmellaw.github.io/tags.html#standard-form-ref)).  These form the basis, along with the notation and terminology, for the sharing and linking of various areas of mathematics.  You will recognise them again and again in the expressions of the patterns, algorithms, laws and theorems.  These are discussed at length whenever we first encounter them.

Finally, to cement all this together, I've allowed myself some digressions in the form of _asides, comments, explicit disambiguations and personal conclusions_.  I hope they are more useful than they are distracting.{% sidenote 'sn-id-whatever' "You'll see these in the form of sidenotes." %}

## !!!!!! TO COMPLETE !!!!!!!!!!! A Note on Already (Half) Knowing Things
e.g. Square Roots

You are going on a pedagogic ourney.  There are others.  But respect this one. It'll make life easier.  Then, once it is complete, you can go back and chart a different path around and between the same mental landmarks.

## Afore ye go
Hopefully with all this making sense you should be ready to embark on the journey itself.  I hope you enjoy it.  Personally I found it _massively_ rewarding.  But before you go, I've one small favour to ask.

Because I'm a software engineer I've made the source of this book available.  As a software engineer I'm also aware that there may be errors or inaccuracies or gaps.  If you find any, I'd really appreciate it if you could log a bug and I'll fix it and give you credit.

To do this just visit [GITHUB] and create a new issue with as much information as you can so that I can make the fix.
