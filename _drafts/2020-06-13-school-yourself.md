{% newthought "Over Christmas 2018" %} I read an article by journalist, author and broadcaster [Gary Younge](https://twitter.com/garyyounge) entitled "[My year of reading African women](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/dec/15/novels-african-women-female-authors)".  It told how, after speaking to the Nigerian author [Chibundu Onuzu](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/01/chibundu-onuzo-welcome-to-lagos-interview), he'd realised there was a significant gap in his reading, and went on to introduce the eighteen books that he'd read throughout the next twelve months. A great array of works, all by African women, and encompassing 

> "love stories, short stories, multi-generational sagas, political novels, ghosts, infertility, coups, occupations and migration stories, written in the voices of white English men and women, first, second, third and fourth wives, children, slaves and slavers, ranging over four continents and in every century from the 16th onwards."

I looked down his list. I'd read none of them. I'd not even heard of most of them, neither works nor authors.  I thought about what I did read - I wasn't only ignoring black African women authors. My book-pile, both read and to-read, was almost exclusively comprised of cis, white, heterosexual, western men.

One if the current cliches is to state that "COVID-19 has brought us all together", but it has actually highlighted how much dives us.  Even without the tragic death of George Floyd (AND XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX) there would be urgent issues which we ought to face as a society.




The world has changed all of a sudden. In many, many ways. Many think it needs to keep changing, and resolve the many crises 

I'm not alone
we;re all in out bubbles
yet now, suddenly people are aware of their priviledge, and simultaneously aware of how unaware they are of otherexperiences, iother  stories, other narratives. 

The incliunation is to reach out, to ask for help, but this isnt acceptable. Its placeing one burden on minorities in place of another.

We shoudl instead school ourselves.  There are resources out there already, we just need to get out of our bubble and read them
