{% newthought "I keep coming up " %} with notes and ideas for posts on organisations faster than I can write them. 

This page is where I'm keeping everything.  Th4e vast majority take and expand upon my idea of "[the organisation viewed as a set of services]( {% post_url 2021-03-27-the-organisation-as-collection-of-services %} )". It's a short post, so it might be worth taking a look if you;ve not already.

## Ideas for Posts
* Who loses? Who don't these services-as-implemented work for? Who do they harm? Whom do they silence?
* Patterns of org-service delivery
* Gloss on "[How To Organize A Large Company Without Middle Management](https://corporate-rebels.com/how-to-organize-a-large-organization-without-middle-management/)" and "[4 Future-Proof Organizational Models Beyond Hierarchy And Bureaucracy](https://corporate-rebels.com/4-future-proof-organizational-models-beyond-hierarchy-and-bureaucracy/)"
* What happens when there is no "workplace" and we go all-remote? What about all-async?
* At what level do these services act, and whom do each of these services serve? The individual, the team, or the organisation? Does it depend on the implementation?
* What are the service-implementations in “[Requisite Organisation](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1878750.Requisite_Organization)” by Jaques
* What are the services in OSS projects inc. a gloss of the "[Beautiful Architecture](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5962507-beautiful-architecture)" chapter on KDE dev and how it works at Mozilla, Wordpress and  Hashicorp (plus thoughts on “Inner Source”...)
* Organisational "literacy" - reading organisations, and discerning the service-implementations, official and unofficial
* “But will it scale?” (How to scale. When and how to phase-shift when scaling one set of service-implementations breaks)
* Attitude sand Aptitudes - skills (and recognition/progression) and job roles
* Org-services from an anarchist perspective
* What are the service-implementations in a [Teal Org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teal_organisation)? (and in others of Laloux's hierarchy)
* Perspectives on the Netflix Culture Deck and "[Powerful](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36417234-powerful)" by Patty McCord
* What are the service-implentations in DDD's [strategic patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design#Strategic_domain-driven_design)?
* An org-services view of "[Turn the Ship Around!](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16158601-turn-the-ship-around)"
* An org-services view of the [Google re:Work project](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/managers-identify-what-makes-a-great-manager/steps/learn-about-googles-manager-research/)

## Notes & Puzzles 
* [Sociotechnical Architecture: People and Resources](https://github.com/matthewskelton/sociotechnical-architecture)
* How do we achieve org-services change? - Via structure/process (bureaucracy) or culture? 
* How to remove bureaucracy and replace it with culture (c.f. enabling constraints and “[tight loose tight](https://markcolgate.com/2018/09/05/the-power-of-tight-loose-tight/)”)
* What about the things we don’t even realise are assumptions - “employment”, hierarchy, job titles / specialisation-based splits
* Unintended consequences - positive and negative
* WTF is “Leadership” in light of this?
* ["we had confused the organizational structure with the communication structure, a common error" - Ed Catmull](https://twitter.com/TotherAlistair/status/1208164723038003201)
* [“The people in your organization are already self-organizing within the bounds of the current constraints. Don't like the results? Look at the constraints.”  - @estherderby](https://twitter.com/docondev/status/1200419392808456192)
