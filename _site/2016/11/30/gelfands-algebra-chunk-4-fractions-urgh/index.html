      <h1>Gelfand: Chunk 4 - Fractions (Urgh)</h1>
<p class="subtitle">November 30, 2016</p>


<p>Yet another of my mental stumbling-blocks today: fractions.<label for="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Urgh. </span></p>

<p>It amused me slightly to read on Google’s “define” page that they are termed “vulgar fractions”.  I couldn’t agree more.</p>

<p>But they’re important (isn’t everything?) and so I’m forcing myself to work through this slowly to build yet another chunk.  If you’re concerned you might be patronised reading this, please pass it by - you probably will be.  It’s more an excercise to hammer the full detail home to myself and avoid another skim-read.  Why? I’m enthused already by the power, durability and utility of the first chunks I built up in prior posts, and want to get more.</p>

<h2 id="the-constituent-parts">The Constituent Parts</h2>
<p>From Google “define”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Numerator: The part above the line, showing how many parts of the denominator are taken.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Denominator: The part below the line, showing the divisor (how many parts a single thing is divided onto.)</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="basic-fraction-manipulations">Basic Fraction Manipulations</h2>
<p>(From Gelfand, Section 34: Converting a Rational Expression into the Quotient of Two Polynomials.)</p>

<h3 id="addition">Addition</h3>
<p>To add, if you don’t have one to begin with, start by finding a common denominator for <span>​<script type="math/tex">\frac{P}{Q}</script></span> and <span>​<script type="math/tex">\frac{R}{S}</script></span>. (If we have no better idea , just multiply <span>​<script type="math/tex">P</script></span> and <span>​<script type="math/tex">Q</script></span> by <span>​<script type="math/tex">S</script></span> and multiply <span>​<script type="math/tex">R</script></span> and <span>​<script type="math/tex">S</script></span> by <span>​<script type="math/tex">Q</script></span>).  Then just add the numerators.</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \frac{P}{Q} + \frac{R}{S}  = </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> = \frac{PS}{QS} + \frac{QR}{QS} = </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> = \frac{PS + QR}{QS} </script></div>

<p>In fact, as you see in the Stewarts Calculus <a href="http://www.stewartcalculus.com/data/ESSENTIAL%20CALCULUS%20Early%20Transcendentals/upfiles/ess-reviewofalgebra.pdf">Review of Algebra</a>, when you add two fractions with the same denominator, you are using the <em>Distributive Law</em>.</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{b} = \frac{1}{b} \cdot a + \frac{1}{b} \cdot c = \frac{1}{b}(a + c) = \frac{a + c}{b} </script></div>

<p>And given this, it is therefore true that</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \frac{a + c}{b} = \frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{b} </script></div>

<p>but remember to avoid the commonly associated pitfall</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \frac{a}{b + c} \neq \frac{a}{b} + \frac{a}{c} </script></div>

<h3 id="subtraction">Subtraction</h3>
<p>Subtraction is similar to addition. Again start by finding a common denominator for <span>​<script type="math/tex">\frac{P}{Q}</script></span> and <span>​<script type="math/tex">\frac{R}{S}</script></span>. (If we have no better idea , just multiply <span>​<script type="math/tex">P</script></span> and <span>​<script type="math/tex">Q</script></span> by <span>​<script type="math/tex">S</script></span> and <span>​<script type="math/tex">S</script></span> by <span>​<script type="math/tex">Q</script></span>).  Then just subtract the numerators:</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \frac{P}{Q} - \frac{R}{S} = </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> = \frac{PS}{QS} - \frac{QR}{QS} = </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> = \frac{PS - QR}{QS} </script></div>

<h3 id="multiplication">Multiplication</h3>
<p>This is the simplest of the lot. Simply multiply one numerator by the other, and one denominator by the other:</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \frac{P}{Q} \times \frac{R}{S} = </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> = \frac{PR}{QS} </script></div>

<p>Additionally, from Stewart’s Calculus <a href="http://www.stewartcalculus.com/data/ESSENTIAL%20CALCULUS%20Early%20Transcendentals/upfiles/ess-reviewofalgebra.pdf">Review of Algebra</a>, it is true that</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \frac{-a}{b} = - \frac{a}{b} = \frac{a}{-b} </script></div>

<h3 id="division">Division</h3>

<p>To divide, invert (the denominator fraction) and mulitply</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \frac{P/Q}{R/S} = </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> = \frac{P}{Q} \times \frac{S}{R} = </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> = \frac{PS}{QR} </script></div>

<h3 id="simplification">Simplification</h3>
<p>Sometimes during the transformation we are able to simplify the expression, eliminating a common factor in the numberator and the denominator:</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \frac{PX}{QX} = \frac{P}{Q} </script></div>

<h2 id="tricks-for-comparing-fractions">Tricks for Comparing Fractions</h2>
<p>Gelfand loves to get his readers to compare fractions.  Luckily he gives us a few tricks along the way.</p>

<h3 id="finding-the-common-denominator">Finding the Common Denominator</h3>
<p>This is the one I recall from school.</p>

<p>Which is bigger, <span>​<script type="math/tex">\frac{1}{3}</script></span> or <span>​<script type="math/tex">\frac{2}{7}</script></span>?</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \frac{1}{3} = \frac{7}{21} </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \frac{2}{7} = \frac{6}{21} </script></div>

<p>Therefore the first fraction is the bigger (there are more 21ths): <span>​<script type="math/tex">\frac{7}{21} \gt \frac{6}{21}</script></span></p>

<h3 id="finding-the-common-numerator">Finding the Common Numerator</h3>
<p>Gelfand next introduces another method, one I’d never seen before, finding a common numerator:</p>

<p>Which is bigger, <span>​<script type="math/tex">\frac{1}{3}</script></span> or <span>​<script type="math/tex">\frac{2}{7}</script></span>?</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{6} > \frac{2}{7} </script></div>

<p>What would indicate to you which was worth using?  I presume that if you can see an easy mathematical route to make the denominators the same use the first method, but if you can see an easier route to make the numerators the same, then use that instead.</p>

<h3 id="the-difference-between-two-fractions-both-of-which-are-less-than-one">The Difference Between Two Fractions, Both of Which are Less Than One</h3>

<p>First up is the approach from Gelfand’s Problem 40. Which is bigger?:</p>

<p><span>​<script type="math/tex">\frac{10001}{10002}</script></span> or <span>​<script type="math/tex">\frac{100001}{100002}</script></span>?</p>

<p>Gelfand gives us a tip - find the difference between each of these and <span>​<script type="math/tex">\frac{1}{1}</script></span>, the one which gives the smaller fraction, is the larger.</p>

<p>The first fraction first:</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \frac{10002}{10002} - \frac{10001}{10002} = </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> = \frac{(10002 - 10001)}{10002} = </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> = \frac{1}{10002} </script></div>

<p>Then the second fraction:</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \frac{100002}{100002} - \frac{100001}{100002} = </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> = \frac{(100002 - 100001)}{100002} = </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> = \frac{1}{100002} </script></div>

<p>This has given us a common denominator, so comparing them:</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \frac{1}{10002} > \frac{1}{100002} </script></div>

<p>So therefore:</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \frac{10001}{10002} < \frac{100001}{100002} </script></div>

<p>Then Gelfand’s problem 41. Which is bigger?:</p>

<p><span>​<script type="math/tex"> \frac{12345}{54321} </script></span> or <span>​<script type="math/tex">\frac{12346}{54322} </script></span>?</p>

<p>In problem 40, where the fractions were also both less than one, we subtracted <span>​<script type="math/tex">\frac{1}{1}</script></span> from each and saw which was smaller.</p>

<p>Let’s try that again. The first fraction first:</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \frac{54321}{54321} - \frac{12345}{54321} = </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> = \frac{(54321 - 12345)}{54321} = </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> = \frac{41976}{54321} </script></div>

<p>Then the second fraction:</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \frac{54322}{54322} - \frac{12346}{54322} = </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> = \frac{(54322 - 12346)}{54322} = </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> = \frac{41976}{54322} </script></div>

<p>This has given us a common numerator (<span>​<script type="math/tex">41976</script></span>), so comparing them:</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \frac{41976}{54321} > \frac{41976}{54322} </script></div>

<p>Therefore:</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \frac{12345}{54321} < \frac{12346}{54322} </script></div>

<h3 id="how-to-know-which-approch-to-try">How to know which approch to try?</h3>
<p>All this prompts some mental images<label for="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Blindingly obvious ones, but nice to call out all the same. </span> to have in the fraction-wrangling kitbag.  When you are comparing things by denominator, you are saying “the sizes of the pieces of my whole are the same, so how many do I have?” whereas when you are comparing by numerator, you are saying “i have the same number of pieces, but which pieces are bigger / smaller?”</p>

<p>From this therefore drops out the prompt to choose from these two options the state which is easier to get into.  We saw tricks like “subtracting from one” and the standard “common-denominator” approach.  As before, for me I’ll be selecting these once I’ve laid things out mentally to see which makes most sense.</p>

<h2 id="adding-fractions-to-find-something-in-between">“Adding” Fractions to find “something in between”</h2>
<p>Now something a little different. Finding values in between two fractions.</p>

<p>We remembered above that to add fractions, you need to find a common denominator. If you don’t, and just add them, then you end up instead with something in between the two fractions:</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \frac{2}{3} + \frac{5}{7} \Rightarrow \frac{2 + 5}{3 + 7} = \frac{7}{10} </script></div>

<h3 id="dividing-a-stick">Dividing a Stick</h3>
<p>So if this is an error, why is Gelfand bothering to point this out?  Well, in two problem’s time, he produces the stick problem which involves you having this in mind to make it solvable without drawing anything out.</p>

<p>Problem 43 is a problem of comparing various fractions on top of each other.  A length (let’s call it “1”) is divided in three ways:</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \frac{7}{7} </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \frac{13}{13} </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \frac{20}{20} </script></div>

<p>We then make the actual cuts at the 20ths.</p>

<p>This could be a <em>very</em> visual problem.  One which should therefore be ideal for my approach.  Gelfand gets off to a helpful start in his solution by hinting that we can ignore the first and last 20th, as they will have no red or green marks on them.  This makes sense; <span>​<script type="math/tex">\frac{1}{20}</script></span> is less than (i.e. smaller than in stick-bit terms) <span>​<script type="math/tex">\frac{1}{7}</script></span> and <span>​<script type="math/tex">\frac{1}{13}</script></span>.</p>

<p>He then gives us another tip - after deducting these end-bits, we have 18 pieces left, and 18 marks (<span>​<script type="math/tex">(7-1) + (13-1)</script></span>).  This is all good, but there is then a leap which I’m not sure I’m comfortable to make - he states that 18 pieces and 18 marks means no piece will be left without a mark, but what if one piece has two marks? That means one will have none.  Its still not clear to me how this claim can be made.  But lets get to the next step.</p>

<p>Gelfand writes</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Red marks correspond to numbers in the form <span>​<script type="math/tex">\frac{k}{7}</script></span>, green marks correspond to numbers in the form <span>​<script type="math/tex">\frac{l}{13}</script></span>”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We’re meant to have realised at this point that <span>​<script type="math/tex">7 + 13 = 20</script></span>.  Not too much to ask for I suppose.  They we’re supposed to realise that we just saw this kind of pattern when we mis-calculated our fraction addition.  So what does that let us then conclude?</p>

<p>In the failed adding, we accidentally unearthed a way of finding “something in between two fractions”. What would happen then if we just laid out all these sums of <span>​<script type="math/tex">\frac{k}{7}</script></span> plus <span>​<script type="math/tex">\frac{l}{13}</script></span> which we might need to get to our remaining <span>​<script type="math/tex">\frac{something}{20}</script></span></p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \frac{1 + 1}{7 + 13} \Rightarrow \frac{2}{20} </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \frac{1 + 2}{7 + 13} \Rightarrow \frac{3}{20} </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \frac{1 + 3}{7 + 13} \Rightarrow \frac{4}{20} </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \frac{2 + 3}{7 + 13} \Rightarrow \frac{5}{20} </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \frac{2 + 4}{7 + 13} \Rightarrow \frac{6}{20} </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \frac{2 + 5}{7 + 13} \Rightarrow \frac{7}{20} </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \frac{3 + 5}{7 + 13} \Rightarrow \frac{8}{20} </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \frac{3 + 6}{7 + 13} \Rightarrow \frac{9}{20} </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \frac{3 + 7}{7 + 13} \Rightarrow \frac{10}{20} </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \frac{4 + 7}{7 + 13} \Rightarrow \frac{11}{20} </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \frac{4 + 8}{7 + 13} \Rightarrow \frac{12}{20} </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \frac{4 + 9}{7 + 13} \Rightarrow \frac{13}{20} </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \frac{5 + 9}{7 + 13} \Rightarrow \frac{14}{20} </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \frac{5 + 10}{7 + 13} \Rightarrow \frac{15}{20} </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \frac{5 + 11}{7 + 13} \Rightarrow \frac{16}{20} </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \frac{6 + 11}{7 + 13} \Rightarrow \frac{17}{20} </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \frac{6 + 12}{7 + 13} \Rightarrow \frac{18}{20} </script></div>

<p>NOTE: this working-out doesn’t cover all possibilities for <span>​<script type="math/tex">k+l</script></span> because not all these fractions will be next to each other (i.e. you can get to <span>​<script type="math/tex">\frac{13}{20}</script></span> by <span>​<script type="math/tex">\frac{1 + 12}{7 + 13}</script></span> but these marks are not next door on our stick.)  This allowed me to arrive at this progression without having to draw a stick.  That’s handly - but it still allowed me to have a spatial representation of tinngs in my mind.</p>

<p>So what has this given us? Each of our 20ths is a point between two larger fractions (that is they are at a “cut-point”).  This means in our “real world” of the imaginary stick there are <em>almost always</em> cut points directly after a green 13th (seen in the progression above where <span>​<script type="math/tex">l</script></span> stays the same and <span>​<script type="math/tex">k</script></span> increases) and <em>sometimes</em> cut-points after a 7th (seen in the progression above where <span>​<script type="math/tex">l</script></span> increases but <span>​<script type="math/tex">k</script></span> stays the same).</p>

<p>As a result we can conclude:</p>

<p>Firstly, there are <em>never</em> points where a <span>​<script type="math/tex">k</script></span> and an <span>​<script type="math/tex">l</script></span> fall so close that a cut-point is not between them (<span>​<script type="math/tex">7 + 13 = 20</script></span> <em>always</em>).</p>

<p>And secondly, the cut-points never fall directly <em>on</em> a red or green line, because as we can see, all cut-points are <em>between</em> reds and greens (again, <span>​<script type="math/tex">7 + 13 = 20</script></span> <em>always</em>)</p>

<p>We’ve travelled a slightly more scenic route to the conclusion that Gelfand reaches much more rapidly.  But I think it’s informative to point this out clearly.</p>

<h2 id="problem-45---fractions-of-fractions">Problem 45 - Fractions of Fractions</h2>
<p>My solution to this problem was slightly different from the one given in the book (which I don’t personally think makes sense without a but of mental stretching) but it gave me a little extra trick to add to our kit bag.  Here we’re working with a starting length which is not <span>​<script type="math/tex">1</script></span>.  We have instead <span>​<script type="math/tex">\frac{2}{3}m</script></span>, but need to find out the difference between this and <span>​<script type="math/tex">\frac{1}{2}m</script></span>, an we need this difference in terms of a fraction of <span>​<script type="math/tex">\frac{2}{3}m</script></span>.</p>

<p>We could go the route of making the denominators common:</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \frac{2}{3}m = \frac{4}{6}m </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \frac{1}{2}m = \frac{3}{6}m</script></div>

<p>And then, by comparing them we can see that the difference is <span>​<script type="math/tex">\frac{1}{6}m</script></span>.</p>

<p>But we don’t need our answer in terms of fractions of a meter, we need it in terms of fractions of <span>​<script type="math/tex">\frac{2}{3}m</script></span>.  This is actually very easy to obtain.  We have our fractions expressed with common denominators, so now just need to compare the relative sizes of numerators.  In this case we have <span>​<script type="math/tex">4</script></span> of something, and we need <span>​<script type="math/tex">3</script></span>, which means we need to cut off <span>​<script type="math/tex">\frac{1}{4}</script></span> of the string.</p>

<p>This is a pretty long-winded route however.  You could also do the following:</p>

<p>First we ask <span>​<script type="math/tex">\frac{1}{2}</script></span> is how much of <span>​<script type="math/tex">\frac{2}{3}</script></span>? To find the answer we divide the former by the latter (just as we would if we were, for example, asking <span>​<script type="math/tex">50</script></span> is how much of <span>​<script type="math/tex">100</script></span>?).</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \frac{1/2}{2/3} = \frac{1 \cdot 3}{2 \cdot 2} = \frac{3}{4}</script></div>

<p>So therefore we need to take away <span>​<script type="math/tex">\frac{1}{4}</script></span> of the existing string.  Nice and simple.</p>

<h2 id="neighbour-fractions">Neighbour Fractions</h2>
<p>(From Gelfand, Problem 42)</p>

<p>We jumped ahead a little in the book, missing out Problem 41.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Fractions <span>​<script type="math/tex">\frac{a}{b}</script></span> and <span>​<script type="math/tex">\frac{c}{d}</script></span> are called “<em>Neighbour Fractions”</em> if their difference <span>​<script type="math/tex">\frac{ad-bc}{bd}</script></span> has numberator <span>​<script type="math/tex">±1</script></span>, that is <span>​<script type="math/tex">ad - bc = ±1</script></span>.”</p>

<p>Coming back to them now, I can begin to pick up on why Gelfand might have introduced them.  They made little sense to me however when I came across them chronologically in the book.  This time, bearing in mind some of the other techniques from <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18693655-a-mind-for-numbers">Oakley</a><label for="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Namely “read ahead”, and “do some additional research” </span> I read around these on wikipedia and came across the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farey_sequence">Farey Sequence</a>.  It turns out they are super-interesting, and also have some beautiful physical manifestations <label for="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Which was very satisfying to me. </span></p>

<p>With this in mind, can we start to tackle the three questions Gelfand has around this?  I’m not so sure, because one <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/243387607/Gelfand-Algebra-Solutions">solutions-text available freely on the interwebs</a> states that these three are the hardest in the whole book, and that the author of that text, Adrian Durham thought there was no way a student could get to the proofs requested based on what they can reliably know at this point in their journey.</p>

<p>Consequently, I’ll satisfy myself for now with making-super-evident the ready-made formulation to calculate differences between fractions which Gelfand slips in:</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \frac{ad-bc}{bd} </script></div>

<p>Is there a way to get to this form what we already know?:</p>

<p>A difference is one fraction minus another.  So let’s enact these steps formally  with <span>​<script type="math/tex">\frac{a}{b}</script></span> and <span>​<script type="math/tex">\frac{c}{d}</script></span>:</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \frac{a}{b} - \frac{c}{d} = </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> = \frac{ad}{bd} - \frac{cb}{db} = </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> = \frac{ad - bc}{bd} </script></div>

<p>Just what we’d expect.  Nice.</p>

<p>I’ll be back to this super-interesting topic in the future.<br />
Meanwhile, have a crack at them yourself if you like.</p>
