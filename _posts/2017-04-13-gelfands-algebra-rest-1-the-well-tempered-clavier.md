I'm not (for now) going to provide any gloss or commentary on sections 44 and 45 of Gelfand, nor do I see much purpose in adding to the builds provded by Durham.  

I might come back to them later I suppose, but at the moment it seems unnecessary.

Instead, let's move on to Section 46 with [Chunk 24 - Equations Schmequations]().
