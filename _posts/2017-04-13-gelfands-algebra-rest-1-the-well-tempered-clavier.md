{% newthought "I'm not (for now) going to provide any gloss or commentary on sections 44 and 45 of Gelfand," %} nor do I see much purpose in adding to the builds provded by Durham.  

I might come back to them later I suppose, but at the moment it seems unnecessary.

Instead, you can jump straight to Section 46 with [Chunk 24 - Equations Schmequations](https://andrewharmellaw.github.io/2017/04/25/gelfands-algebra-chunk-24-equations-schmequations) or you can take a detour via [a disambiguation  of the various meanings in Mathematics of the word "Root"](https://andrewharmellaw.github.io/2017/04/24/gelfands-algebra-aside-3-roots-roots-and-more-roots). 

It's your choice.
