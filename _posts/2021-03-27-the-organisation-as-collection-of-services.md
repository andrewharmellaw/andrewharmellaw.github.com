(This post is second in a series.  Part one, "[Is Your Organisation Broken?]({% post_url 2021-03-26-is-your-organisation-broken %})" sets the scene for this post's proposal of a new way to look at organisations.)

{% newthought "I've wondered for a long time " %}if there’s value in looking at _all_ organisations through a lens which treats employees as consumers of services the organisation provides, and then asks "how does the way you organise provide these services?"

This might seem a bit meta, so here's two examples. The multinational conglomerate Acme Corp follows a "traditional" model of organisations in that it is hierarchical, and bureaucratic.  This model offers services such as "work allocation" and "decision making" and in both cases (at least officially) these services are provided via a "performed by a named individual at the appropriate level of management who follows a documented process" approach.

Meanwhile the small startup Mom & Pop Soda Shop Inc follows a "trust" model in that anyone is expected to spot things which need to be done, and are permitted to do them.  This model offers the same services ("work allocation" and "decision making") but here both are provided via a "all employees are empowered to do the right thing ad hoc and whenever required" mechanism.

How different organisations provides these "internal" services will clearly vary greatly, but I think (bear with me) that _there is a finite set of services that all organisations provide_ purely by dint of their being an organisation.  Sometimes an organisation will provide one or more of these services explicitly, and other times it will provide some of them implicitly (or even by accident).  Furthermore, some services will be provided officially, and others unofficially. Sometimes both types will be at play at once, one most likely working more efficiently than another.  

Finally, please note that this breakdown says nothing about the quality or fit of any of the service implementations in a given organisation.  The services as delivered might be terrible, or they might be excellent.  They might conflict with or contradict one another.

With this in mind we can get to the services themselves.  I am no org-design expert (I've just read a lot, and consulted in a lot of places, and like to nerd-out and find how other folks organisations work) but I _hope_ that the items on this list are both collectively exhaustive and mutually exclusive.  Finally I've tried to put them in order of importance.  It is likely that in _all_ organisations the first two services are explicit. Only in larger organisations might later / all other services be so.

I've tried to use a service-design style way of representing this which names the service, gives the need it meets, the outcome it provides, and the value it delivers.<BR/><BR/>

|**Service** |**Need**|**Outcome**|**Value**|
|:--------|:--------|:--------|:--------|
**Skill / resource allocation**  | Right people with the right tasks and required resources to perform them | Tasks and resources allocated.<BR/>Tasks performed | Quality outputs.<BR/>Personal sense of purpose.<BR/>Accountability 
<BR/>**Communication** | <BR/>Timely and accurate information required to perform a task | <BR/>Information at the right place at the right time | <BR/>Efficient and productive organisation 
<BR/>**(Long term) direction** | <BR/>Strategy/vision/mission/goals based on sensing world outside the organisation | <BR/>Alignment and focus of effort (decision criteria) | <BR/>Organisational purpose
<BR/>**Decisions** | <BR/>Good decisions made efficiently and effectively | <BR/>Timely decisions rapidly made | <BR/>Progress aligned with direction.<BR/>Efficient use of people’s efforts
<BR/>**Co-ordination** | <BR/>Groups of people (and resources) doing the right thing at the right time.<BR/>Keep in sync with others | <BR/>Co-ordinated activities and allocation of resources | <BR/>Reduction in waiting / blocking
<BR/>**Constitution** | <BR/>Clarity on what the organisation values and what it will (and won’t) tolerate | <BR/>No “rogue” (i.e. contrary to the constitution) elements | <BR/>Clear checks and balances
<BR/>**Recognition** | <BR/>Recognition for my skills and contribution (my value to the organisation) | <BR/>Salary, job title, etc. | <BR/>Sense of self-worth
<BR/>**Conflict management** | <BR/>People held to account for their actions (or lack of them) | <BR/>Alignment to  “rules of the game” and social norms.<BR/>Conflict resolution | <BR/>Increased collaboration.<BR/>Predictability.<BR/>More efficient delivery of organisational goals
<BR/>**Learning** | <BR/>Personal development, additional / improved skills | <BR/>Better skills available within the organisation<BR/>Feeling of personal satisfaction | <BR/>Greater organisational productivity. Increased loyalty to the organisation

<BR/>

That's it for now. In my following posts I want to look at various organisations and organisational styles and see how these services might map onto them.


<!--Joe Schrag: It might be interesting to think around which are directly important to the members and which are a byproduct of the org.  For example, for the individual,  the need for community is huge, especially with shared purpose.  To need others and to be needed.  To be a contributor to the tribe.  Seems like that could be 1 + 6 (skills + constitution).  On the other hand, I would argue 5 (coordination) is not directly as important to the individual, but needed in an org.
It might be helpful to think of them in a hierarchy as well.  A lot in common here with Maslow’s hierarchy.
Perhaps also worth noting that specific versions of some of these needs can lead to less desirable results.  The one the comes to mind is conquest (perhaps part of 3).  Some individuals have a need for it, and many orgs prioritize it. -->
