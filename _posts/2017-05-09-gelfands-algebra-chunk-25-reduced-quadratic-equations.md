### Tricks Arising - Working with Square Roots (!!!!!DRAFT!!!!!)
I seem to have a semi mental-block about roots.  I'm not sure why but they still don't sit comfortably with me. Not as comfortably as some other mathematical concepts.  

Consequently, I'm hoping writing out some of the standard operations you can perform with and on square roots will help me, just in the way that a similar approach with fractions worked wonders.

* x -> square it -> root it -> x
* x -> root it -> square it -> x ???? always true???
* square root of 2 = irrational number
* root everything then square everything
