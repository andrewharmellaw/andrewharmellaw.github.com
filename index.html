	    <h1>Welcome</h1>
		<p class="subtitle"></p>	
	      
<p><span class="newthought">Hello and welcome to</span>  my blog-aggregator.</p>

<p>Over the years I’ve been a little profligate with my internet prescence. Here’s a handy overview, with some deep links into the semi-interesting bits.</p>

<p>If I was to sum up everything that I have collected here it would “a series of attempts at <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23503006-unflattening">unflattening</a>”. That is to say I’m trying to reconsider how I, and others, construct knowledge, and challenge when I think things could be different.</p>

<p>Beginning with my first conference talk at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znQtAIpXlP4">Devoxx UK in 2014</a>, right up to my current blog series’ on the <a href="index-xp-of-dev.html">experience of development</a> and <a href="index.orgs.html">organisations</a> I’ve been trying to understand why things are they way they are; to bring different perspectives; and ask challenging questions.</p>

<p>Sometimes this involves pointing out what I think we’ve forgotten. Other times it’s to suggest parallels and contrasts with other disciplines.  Other times still I’m just trying to figure stuff out and wanted to share my progress.</p>

<p>There are three sections to all this, based on the medium of my musings: Training, Speaking / Panels, Open Source, and Blogging.  You can also find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/al94781">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewharmellaw">LinkedIn</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for my algebra blog which used to live here, <a href="index-algebra.html">it’s not gone far</a>.</p>

<h1 id="training">Training</h1>
<p>I was fortunate to be asked to write a course for the O’Reilly online training Platform. The result, a three-hour, hands-on extravaganza is titled <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/live-training/courses/domain-driven-design-first-steps/0636920051628/">Domain-Driven Design: First Steps</a> and runs every 2 months or so.</p>

<h1 id="speaking--panels">Speaking / Panels</h1>
<p>I’ve been lucky enough to talk at a bunch of UK and international conferences. My main contributions have been as follows:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozB-60pGbDM">Patterns and People</a> (Lightning talk, DDD Europe, 2021)</p>

<h1 id="open-source">Open Source</h1>
<p>I never get as much time as I’d like to work on open source, but I’ve been lucky to have been around for some cool moments.</p>

<p>I was there at the founding of the <a href="https://plugins.jenkins.io/job-dsl/">Jenkins JobDSL</a> (which is still in Jenkins core and - I’m told - partially inspired the Jenkinsfile we have today).</p>

<p>I also started the <a href="https://github.com/andrewharmellaw/archaius-spring-adapter">archaius-spring-adapter</a>, created the open source <a href="https://github.com/Capgemini/grade-ladder">Capgemini Grade Ladder</a>, and contributed <a href="https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/issues/3098">some documentation improvements</a> for the Pony language.</p>

<p>Sadly my most-starred repo is 100% based on the work of others - an <a href="https://github.com/andrewharmellaw/wardley-maps-book">ascii-doc-ification</a> of <a href="https://twitter.co/swardley">Simon Wardley’s</a> Wardley Mapping blog posts.</p>

<h1 id="blogging">Blogging</h1>
<h2 id="thoughtworks">Thoughtworks</h2>
<p>So far, I’ve only written one post for the ThoughtWorks Insights blog: “<a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/domain-driven-design-neednt-be-hard-heres-how-start">Domain-driven design needn’t be hard. Here’s how to start</a>”.</p>

<h2 id="capgemini">Capgemini</h2>
<p>At my previous employer, I and a <a href="https://twitter.com/tsphethean">co-conspirator</a> set up the <a href="https://capgemini.github.io/">Capgemini engineering blog</a>.</p>

<p>Some of my posts include, “<a href="https://capgemini.github.io/development/how-we-work/">How we work</a>” (co-authored with Malcom Young), “<a href="https://capgemini.github.io/architecture/why-microservices-are-right-for-us-pt1">Why microservices are right for us</a>”, “<a href="https://capgemini.github.io/architecture/microservices-reality-check/">Microservices - a reality check(point)</a>”, “<a href="https://capgemini.github.io/development/its-sometimes-clever-to-admit/">When it’s clever to admit that you’re not feeling clever</a>”, and 
“<a href="https://capgemini.github.io/learning/last-year-an-unconf/">Last year an unconference changed my life</a>”.</p>

<p>I also wrote the <a href="https://capgemini.github.io/engineering/Capgemini-Engineering-Diversity-Manifesto/">response from the Capgemini UK Engineering team to the James Damore Anti-Diversity Manifesto</a>.</p>

<h2 id="learning-algebra">Learning Algebra</h2>
<p>Hidden behind this landing page is <a href="index-algebra.html">the math blog</a> I wrote as I worked my way through <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2140100.Algebra">Gelfand’s “Algebra”</a>.</p>

<h2 id="learning-new-programming-languages">Learning new Programming Languages</h2>
<p>As with algebra so with programming languages. I blogged as I learned <a href="https://scalaeyeforthejavaguy.blogspot.com/">Scala</a>, and <a href="https://rubyeyeforthejavaguy.blogspot.com/">Ruby</a>, and managed fitful attempts as I picked up <a href="https://grokkinggolang.github.io/">Go</a>.</p>

<h2 id="medium">Medium</h2>
<p>I also flirted with a Medium blog for a while. The two best posts are “<a href="https://medium.com/@andrewharmellaw/warhammer-fantasy-career-planning-405b3b6f0d6a">Warhammer fantasy career planning</a>” and “<a href="https://medium.com/@andrewharmellaw/yet-another-post-on-work-life-balance-dc69781ed732">Yet another post on work-life balance</a>”</p>

<h2 id="blogger">Blogger</h2>
<p>I started (and found my feet) blogging on one of the original platforms - blogger - where the title of <a href="https://the-music-of-time.blogspot.com/">my blog</a> is the best thing about it.</p>
