<p><em>NOTE: This post is part of my extended series on the “Experience of Development”. If you’ve not read the two-part introduction yet, it’s perhaps a good idea to hop over and check out <a href="/xp-of-dev/2021/03/08/the-experience-of-development-a-conjecture">part 1</a> and <a href="/xp-of-dev/2021/03/09/the-experience-of-development-models-all-the-way-down">part 2</a> before continuing.</em></p>

<p><span class="newthought">There are many</span>  feelings, a myriad you might say.  And it has struck me <a href="/xp-of-dev/2021/03/07/the-experience-of-development-preface">again and again</a> how, despite the incredibly intellectual nature of developing code, it can surface such extremes of emotion in all of us.</p>

<p>Despite this, I’ve spent a significant number of the posts in this series frankly skirting the issue of emotion.  I now intend to make my first foray into it, broadly at first, but in an attempt to both clarify the scope of the terrain before us, as well as to sketch out some of the key prompts which I believe give rise to these upswellings.</p>

<p>I have taken for my source of the gamut of emotions the extensive lists in Marshall Rosenberg’s Non-Violent Communication.  He catalogues both good, and bad feelings.  I have further subdivided them.</p>

<p><strong>Does the emotion arise from the surprise and mis-match, or does it arise from the (re)manipulation of mental models to build things / resolve problems?</strong></p>

<p>Let’s pick good feelings: joyous/joyful, alert, animated, buoyant, cheerful, confident, contented, delighted, energetic, gleeful, involved, mellow, optimistic, pleasant, pleased, proud, satisfied, stimulated, upbeat</p>

<p>Moving into flow: engrossed, absorbed, intense, serene, spellbound, focused</p>

<p>Later (after flow?) we can do: amazed, appreciative, astonished, enchanted, grateful, gratified, inspired, ecstatic, exultant, invigorated, elated, moved, blissful, glorious, dazzled, radiant, rapturous, splendid, thrilled, wonderful</p>

<p>How about?: curious, eager, encouraged, expectant, fascinated, inquisitive, interested, intrigued, warm, wide-awake, zestful</p>

<p>What about?: calm, carefree, glad, alive, comfortable, composed, fulfilled, friendly, quiet, peaceful, refreshed, relaxed, secure, trusting, free, zestful</p>

<p>And then again?: complacent, concerned, hopeful</p>

<p>Or?: Overwhelmed, sensitive</p>

<p>But?: relieved, thankful,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>building mental models is absolutely central to why I enjoy or why I am reasonably competent at development, or more broadly, computers. I can look back to loving logic puzzles as a kid, which are largely exercises in evaluating all of the data, creating a model from that and then verifying that your model holds up. Crosswords &amp; Sudoku are this in miniature; the scientific process applied is it in major (Drew Stephens on Slack)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>How surprise affects development, which I suspect you’ll talk more about in subsequent posts, is important—being surprised is evidence that the model you had was wrong, which means that you probably have a failure that needs fixing (the source of your surprise), a mental model that needs to be altered, and emotional toll of being fundamentally wrong about something (Drew Stephens on Slack)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The ability to reduce the amount of information I need to keep in my head is why I find dynamically-typed languages so limiting—it’s hard to think about larger problems when you have to manually keep track of what is passed into/returned from methods and etc. (Drew Stephens on Slack)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am reminded of how frustrating using Windows was (context: I last used Windows XP circa 2004)—it’s built around not altering existing behavior while extending the system, leading to pervasive inconsistency. Things that work in one place don’t work, or work differently, all little surprises. Being an expert at Windows, or something like it, is not so much about having a mental model, but by committing innumerable tiny rules to memory (Drew Stephens on Slack)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s it for this post. I’m going to keep sharing these musings, and hopefully also begin to bring in some specific case-studies of how development is experienced by specific individuals. In the meantime I’d love to know what you think.
