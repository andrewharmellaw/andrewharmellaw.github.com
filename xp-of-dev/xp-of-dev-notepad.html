<p><span class="newthought">I keep coming up </span>  with notes and ideas for posts on the experience of development faster than I can write the posts themselves.</p>

<p>This page is where I’m keeping everything.  The vast majority take and expand upon my <a href="/xp-of-dev/2021/03/08/the-experience-of-development-a-conjecture">conjecture</a> and <a href="/xp-of-dev/2021/03/09/the-experience-of-development-models-all-the-way-down">associated proposals</a> about why it might feel as it does to work with code. They make a bunch of stuff explicit, so it might be worth taking a look at them if you’ve not already.</p>

<h2 id="ideas-for-posts">Ideas for Posts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Mental castle-building. The toil, or ease, by which this happens. The “happy path”, and straying from that path. The wholly-mental aspects of this. Link this back to “models all the way down” an perhaps “fine wines”. Also, mutability? (see chat in SW Dev)</li>
  <li>The expression of the mental model “castles” into code, into syntax. Just thinking about the writing of the code for now, and joining it into the compilation-surprise loop. We can bring in different languages and their syntaxes / sharp edges here. We can also bring in the Virginia Woolf quotes. Thinking in the syntax. (Harvey Richardson? Chris Phelps?) The fit of language to thinking-style and problem space.</li>
  <li>The joy of using tools which fit well in your loop. “I once worked with Harvey. He seemed to be able to think <em>in</em> c-shell, sed and awk. He also had a highly controlled environment. Other people take as much joy in their tools and the expression of their castles into ascii code as Harvey did, with less excuse…”. TDD. Other emotions.</li>
  <li>The “happy path” (and straying from it)</li>
  <li>Writing vs reading code</li>
  <li>Usage of feedback loops (inc. history) - how this is a</li>
  <li>Flow</li>
  <li>Hell is other developers - The minds of others (there is already a need to understand the mind of the machine). Writing vs reading.  (Previously we were thinking about the minds of the machine). Pair programming.  System Metaphors and DDD</li>
  <li>Learning and XP of Dev</li>
  <li>Developer workspaces (and “why?”)</li>
  <li>TDD</li>
  <li>Pair programming</li>
  <li>Flow. Context-swapping</li>
  <li>Debugging</li>
  <li>Personal styles and preferences</li>
  <li>Interviews</li>
  <li>How to think about this yourself</li>
</ul>
