{% newthought "I keep coming up " %} with notes and ideas for posts on the experience of development faster than I can write the posts themselves. 

This page is where I'm keeping everything.  The vast majority take and expand upon my [conjecture]({% post_url 2021-03-08-the-experience-of-development-a-conjecture %}) and [associated proposals]({% post_url 2021-03-09-the-experience-of-development-models-all-the-way-down %}) about why it might feel as it does to work with code. They make a bunch of stuff explicit, so it might be worth taking a look at them if you've not already.

## Ideas for Posts
* Mental castle-building. The toil, or ease, by which this happens. The "happy path", and straying from that path. The wholly-mental aspects of this. Link this back to "models all the way down" an perhaps "fine wines". Also, mutability? (see chat in SW Dev)
* The expression of the mental model "castles" into code, into syntax. Just thinking about the writing of the code for now, and joining it into the compilation-surprise loop. We can bring in different languages and their syntaxes / sharp edges here. We can also bring in the Virginia Woolf quotes. Thinking in the syntax. (Harvey Richardson? Chris Phelps?) The fit of language to thinking-style and problem space. 
* The joy of using tools which fit well in your loop. “I once worked with Harvey. He seemed to be able to think _in_ c-shell, sed and awk. He also had a highly controlled environment. Other people take as much joy in their tools and the expression of their castles into ascii code as Harvey did, with less excuse...”. TDD. Other emotions.
* The “happy path” (and straying from it)
* Writing vs reading code
* Usage of feedback loops (inc. history) - how this is a 
* Flow
* Hell is other developers - The minds of others (there is already a need to understand the mind of the machine). Writing vs reading.  (Previously we were thinking about the minds of the machine). Pair programming.  System Metaphors and DDD
* Learning and XP of Dev
* Developer workspaces (and “why?”)
* TDD
* Pair programming
* Flow. Context-swapping
* Debugging
* Personal styles and preferences
* Interviews
* How to think about this yourself
