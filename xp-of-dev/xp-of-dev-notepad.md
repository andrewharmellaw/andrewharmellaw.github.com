{% newthought "I keep coming up " %} with notes and ideas for posts on the experience of development faster than I can write the posts themselves. 

This page is where I'm keeping everything.  The vast majority take and expand upon my [conjecture]({% post_url 2021-03-08-the-experience-of-development-a-conjecture %}) and [associated proposals]({% post_url 2021-03-09-the-experience-of-development-models-all-the-way-down %}) about why it might feel as it does to work with code. They make a bunch of stuff explicit, so it might be worth taking a look at them if you've not already.
