The key term here? â€œInterpolationâ€.</p>

<p>So what is interpolation?  Iâ€™d suggest you take a break to glance at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpolation">the wikipedia page</a>.  Just a glance though, as the stuff thatâ€™s about to come from Gelfand will give you the tools to deeply grok the contents within.</p>

<p>For those who donâ€™t want to take a look, Interpolation is defined on the page above as</p>

<p>Once weâ€™ve done this (and had an encounter with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler">Euler</a>) Gelfand poses the question upon which he spends the rest of the section, and Iâ€™ll spend the rest of this chunk exploring.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What can be said about a polynomial if we have some information about itâ€™s values?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the interpolation we mentioned above.</p>

<p>But before we get to the values and the interpolation Gelfand gives us another thought tool<label for="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Not really a trick so Iâ€™m not flagging it as such </span> which helps our <em>abstract</em> understanding of polynomials.  Iâ€™m going to try and re-explain it in my own words.<label for="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Primarily because writing these things ensures they are concretely embedded in my mind before proceeding.  You might find Gelfandâ€™s explanation better. Itâ€™s incredibly likely. </span></p>

<p>The first point he is making is that given the information on the degree of a polynomial that is in one degree (thatâ€™s important) we can then make a lot of statements which are <em>guaranteed</em> to be true.  The second point is that if we know some of these key facts, and also the vaules we get out when we put in known values, then we can do a lot of detective work to deduce the polynomial itself, even if we donâ€™t know it.</p>

<h2 id="patterns-in-degrees">Patterns in Degrees</h2>
<p><span class="newthought">This is currently all very abstract;</span>  so letâ€™s look at a few examples.  First up is degrees.  Remember that the degree of a polynomial is related to itâ€™s â€œfirst degreeâ€.  So if a polynomial has a degree of <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">1</script></span> it will be in the general form:</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">ax + b</script></div>

<p>This means that it will <em>definitely</em> have an element in the form <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">ax^1</script></span> and <em>may</em> have an element in the form <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">bx^0</script></span>.  Thatâ€™s it. But we can simplify.  Remember from <a href="https://andrewharmellaw.github.io/2017/02/23/gelfands-algebra-chunk-14-polynomial-division-all-the-gory-details">Chunk 14</a> that <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">bx^0 = b \cdot 1 = b</script></span>.</p>

<p>But I said â€œ<em>may</em>â€ for the <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">b</script></span>-element.  How so?  Technically it will always be there, but if <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">b=0</script></span> then itâ€™ll be irrelevant.  Why does this not happen for <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">a</script></span>-elements?  Because if the above had <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">a = b = 0</script></span> then (as Gelfand states) weâ€™d end up instead with the zero-polynomial which has an undefined value.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s step up our game one more notch.  What about a second-degree polynomial?  You guessed it, it <em>must</em> have an element in the form <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">ax^2</script></span> and <em>may</em> have elements in the form <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">bx^1</script></span> and <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">cx^0</script></span>.  The <em>may</em> bit is again down to whether <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">b</script></span> and <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">c</script></span> are equal to zero or not.</p>

<p>We can keep this pattern going ad-infinitum.  But rather than that, letâ€™s bring it back to Gelfand so weâ€™re all happy we linked back up after diverging explanations.  Letâ€™s re-state it one more time; we can write all our second-degree polynomials in as follows:</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">ax^2 + bx^1 + cx^0</script></div>

<p>Which can be simplified to the general form as follows</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">ax^2 + bx + c</script></div>

<p>Which is where we find Gelfand, waiting patiently for us.</p>

<h2 id="deplying-our-new-found-powers-and-point-two">Deplying Our New-Found Powers (and Point Two)</h2>
<p><span class="newthought">I mentioned a few paragraphs above</span>  that there were <em>two</em> points.  Weâ€™re about to see the second.  Gelfand now gives us some problems, assumes weâ€™re going to use the pattern we just learned, and some other basic skills heâ€™s taught us, and is hoping we easily arrive at the answer.</p>

<h3 id="problem-160">Problem 160</h3>
<p>First thing we need to see with this problem is that when Gelfand states</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œ<span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">P(x)</script></span> is a polynomial of degree not exceeding <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">1</script></span>â€</p>
</blockquote>

<p>we need to immediately think</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œthat means it has the general form <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">ax + b</script></span>â€.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With this in mind, he then gives us a pair of inputs and outputs - the latter being the â€œvaluesâ€ he mentioned and which we are calling â€œpoint twoâ€.  We can lay these out as follows:</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">P(1) = 7</script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">P(2) = 5</script></div>

<p>He then asks us to find <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">P(x)</script></span> which really means â€œfind the values of <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">a</script></span> and <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">b</script></span> and state in the form of a first-degree polynomial.â€</p>

<p>Letâ€™s plug our inputs in and see what we can glean:</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">P(1) = a \cdot 1 + b = 7</script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">P(2) = a \cdot 2 + b = 5</script></div>

<p>The difference between these two is one <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">a</script></span>, or <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">5 - 7</script></span> which is <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">-2</script></span>.  If we plug in this, then we can find <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">b</script></span> easily.</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">-2 \cdot 1 + b = 7</script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \rightarrow -2 + b = 7 </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \rightarrow b = 7 + 2 </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \rightarrow b = 9 </script></div>

<p>We can check this<label for="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">As Iâ€™m making us go <em>painfully slow to make sure this is 100% clear</em> </span> by putting our <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">b</script></span>-value into the second formula to check all is good.</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">P(2) = -2 \cdot 2 + 9 = -4 + 9 = 5</script></div>

<p>W00t!</p>

<p>So to bring it all to a close, we can state <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">P(x)</script></span> as follows</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">P(x) = -2x + 9</script></div>

<p>Bringing his worked example to a close, Gelfand points out what heâ€™s hoped weâ€™d notice - that you can use this trick for any polynomial of degree not exceeding one, given two values of <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">x</script></span>.</p>

<h2 id="its-just-lines">Itâ€™s Just Lines!</h2>
<p><span class="newthought">There has been a dearth of good â€˜ole simple lines in Gelfand for a good while.</span>   Weâ€™re suddenly about to bring them back.  Gelfand next makes sure weâ€™ve well and truly cottoned-on to the significance of what we just found.  He gives us the formula for the graph of a straight line, <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">y = ax + b</script></span>, and then prods us to realise that this is <em>exactly the same as our first-degree polynomial formula</em>.  No wonder we can reverse-engineer things for this polynomial-class with two values.  Thatâ€™s how many you need to figure out all the values on a <em>straight</em> line - something which takes in two points.</p>

<p>Now we begin to see why Gelfand used the â€œregressionâ€ word in the title of this sectionâ€¦</p>

<h2 id="a-simple-but-subtle-point---too-many-zeros">A Simple But Subtle Point - Too Many Zeros</h2>
<p><span class="newthought">Next up is Problem 161.</span>  Iâ€™d missed the significance of this at the first pass.  Weâ€™re staying with at-most-first-degree polynomials for now. Gelfand has given us two inputs (<span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">1</script></span> and <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">2</script></span>) to an undisclosed polynomial <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">P(x)</script></span>, both of which give a result of <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">0</script></span>. He has also informed us that the polynomial is in at most the first degree.  That means it is in the general form <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">ax + b</script></span>.</p>

<p>The problem is to prove that the result is <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">P(x) = 0</script></span> <em>for any</em> <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">x</script></span>.  You can perhaps guess how this miht be the case without putting in the graft of working out <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">a</script></span> and <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">b</script></span>, butâ€™s letâ€™s show it for clarity.</p>

<p><span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">P(1)</script></span> first</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> 1a + b = 0 </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> a = -b </script></div>

<p>Then <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">P(2)</script></span></p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> 2a + b = 0 </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> 2a = -b </script></div>

<p>Therefore, putting them together</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> 2a = -b = a </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> 2a = a </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> a = 0 </script></div>

<p>Which means that</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> a = 0 = -b </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> -b = 0 </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> b = 0 </script></div>

<p>Therefore</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> P(x) = 0x + 0 </script></div>

<p>And from this it is clear to see that no matter what <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">x</script></span> is, the result will always be <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">0</script></span>.  To bring it back to lines, <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">P(x)</script></span> represents a straight horizontal one.</p>

<h2 id="a-further-subtle-point---how-many-is-too-many">A Further Subtle Point - How Many is â€œToo Manyâ€?</h2>
<p><span class="newthought">For a not-greater-than-first-degree polynomial,</span>  two zero results was â€œtoo manyâ€.  But is this the case for a not-greater-than-second-degree polynomial.  It is in Problem 162 that weâ€™re asked to tackle this.</p>

<p>As in Problem 161 Gelfand gives us two zero results: <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">P(1) = 0 </script></span> and <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">P(2) = 0</script></span>.  He then asks if <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">P(x) = 0</script></span> (i.e. are all forms of this polynomial zero).  His solution is a nice one.  Given that we already have two zeros, he first shows us how it is two thirds of the way to being factored:</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">P(x) = (x - 1)(x - 2)Q(x)</script></div>

<p>The first two factors are simply derived from <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">P(1) = 0 </script></span> and <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">P(2) = 0</script></span>.  But what is <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">Q(x)</script></span>? Itâ€™s the last factor.  Factors are polynomials, and because we know that <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">P(x)</script></span> has a maximum degree of 2, that must come from <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">(x - 1)(x - 2)</script></span> (spot the <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">x^2</script></span>?) which means <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">Q(x)</script></span> must be a zero-degree polynomial, aka a number.  And this means that while this number <em>could</em> be zero, (meaning all results of <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">P(x)</script></span> would be zero, it could just as easily be any number, which means we <em>cannot</em> say given when we know from our stated facts (<span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">P(1) = 0 </script></span> and <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">P(2) = 0</script></span>) that <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">P(x)</script></span> is <em>always</em> going to be zero.</p>

<p>Problem 163 then takes just this scenario and gets us to work things through, where <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">Q(x)</script></span> has become <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">a</script></span> in <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">P(x) = a(x - 1)(x - 2)</script></span>.</p>

<p>The second solution to this problem is incredibly useful.  As is frequently the case in Gelfand, you need to not just look at what he does, but also <em>how he does it</em>.</p>

<p>So what does he do? He gets meta. He knows what the polynomials are as pure symbols, and also as the detailed internals.  He then simply does maths on them, as if they were any other number or expression.  I found his wording a little dense, so yet again Iâ€™m going to write out the last steps symbolically to make it super-clear</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> 3a + b = 0 </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> 5a + b = 4 </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> 5a + b - 4 = 0 </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \rightarrow 3a + b = 5a + b - 4 </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \rightarrow b + 4 = 2a + b </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \rightarrow 4 = 2a </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \rightarrow 2 = a </script></div>

<p>Once you know what <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">a</script></span> is, you can calculate <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">b</script></span></p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> 3a + b = 0 </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \rightarrow 3 \times 2 + b = 0 </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \rightarrow 6 + b = 0 </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \rightarrow b = -6 </script></div>

<p>And then, finally, <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">c</script></span></p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> 4 = 2 \times 3^2 - 6 \times 3 + c </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \rightarrow 4 = 0 + c </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \rightarrow c = 4 </script></div>

<h2 id="not-all-lines-are-straight-lines">Not all Lines are Straight Lines</h2>
<p><span class="newthought">Again, with little pause for breath,</span>  Gelfand marches us onward.</p>

<p>Are we approaching a universal axiom? Do we only need <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">n + 1</script></span> input-output value pairs to be able to reverse-engineer a polynomial of degree-not-exceeding <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">n</script></span>?  If first-degree polynomials are represented by straight lines, what do other polynomials look like in line form?</p>

<p>Gelfand gets on to all this lines-stuff later<label for="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Which Iâ€™ll get to in another chunk. </span> but for now be satisfied that yes, polynomials do represent lines, and that these can get pretty complicated unless they are always equal to zero<label for="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">As we discovered above. </span> in which case they are just horizontal at <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">y = 0</script></span>.</p>

<p>In Problem 164 Gelfand breaks out the meta again, asking us to</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>prove that a polynomial of degree not exceeding <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">2</script></span> is defined uniquely by three of its values.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He gives us a bit of a starter, but Iâ€™m going to take my usual tack of working through Gelfandâ€™s solution in far-far finer-grained detail.</p>

<p>First up are the simple parts; grokking exactly what heâ€™s asking - when he says â€œuniquely defined by three of its valuesâ€ he means that if two polynomials are defined by the same three values, then they too are the same.  He then takes this, and writes it with symbols rather than words; a trick weâ€™re slowy getting used to.</p>

<p><span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">P(x)</script></span> and <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">Q(x)</script></span> represent our two polynmomials.  Gelfand represents their having the same output values given the same inputs by saying <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">P(x_{1}) = Q(x_{1})</script></span>, <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">P(x_{2}) = Q(x_{2})</script></span> and <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">P(x_{3}) = Q(x_{3})</script></span>.  To be clear, he lets on that <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">x_{1}</script></span>, <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">x_{2}</script></span> and <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">x_{3}</script></span> are three different values of <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">x</script></span>.  And that if these three circumstances hold true, then <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">P(x) = Q(x)</script></span>, which is to say, they are equal.</p>

<p>With all this in mind Gelfand then breaks out another proof-trick weâ€™ve not seen before<label for="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">At least I donâ€™t think so. </span>  He introduces a third polynomial <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">R(x)</script></span>.  Why?  Letâ€™s rewind a step.</p>

<p>Gelfand is taking advantage of a property of polynomial roots which Iâ€™d forgotten about - this property is that a polynomial of a degree not exceeding 2 can have at most two roots, <em>unless it is equal to zero</em><label for="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Which is what we saw in Problem 161 above. </span>  Itâ€™s the bit in <em>italics</em> that is being used here because heâ€™s going to use it to show that all other polynomials which support these input-output pairs are equal to zero.  Letâ€™s see how.</p>

<p>Gelfand next brings in something else fundamental, but this time also blindingly obvious: that if two things are the same, then one minus the other gives you zero.  I.e. <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">P(x) - Q(x) = 0</script></span>.</p>

<p>When he combines the two, we get our proof. We need to have a symbol to represent the outcome of subtracting one polynomial from another and that is <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">R(x)</script></span>.  The following should now make more sense</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">P(x) - Q(x) = R(x)</script></div>

<p>and</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">P(x) - Q(x) = 0</script></div>

<p>because extrapolating what we had previously</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">P(x_{1}) - Q(x_{1}) = 0</script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">P(x_{2}) - Q(x_{2}) = 0</script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">P(x_{3}) - Q(x_{3}) = 0</script></div>

<p>therefore</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">R(x_{1}) = R(x_{2}) = R(x_{3}) = 0</script></div>

<p>Which means that <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">P(x) = Q(x)</script></span> so they are the same, so therefore â€œa polynomial of degree not exceeding <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">2</script></span> is defined uniquely by three of itâ€™s values.â€</p>

<h3 id="a-confession">A Confession</h3>
<p><span class="newthought">Iâ€™ll admit</span>  I would have never got here on my own.  Iâ€™m sure thatâ€™s why its a problem with a solution.  Weâ€™re supposed to realise that the tricks just performed before our eyes are permissable.  That means there are some new tricks to be gleaned.</p>

<h2 id="tricks-arising">Tricks Arising</h2>

<h3 id="flip-it">Flip It</h3>
<p>Gelfand didnâ€™t attack this proof head on. He came round the back.  He didnâ€™t try and prove there was only on polynomial for the given values, and instead took another route of treating himself to two, and then proving that they were in fact the same, single thing.</p>

<p>The proving they were in fact the same thing but just with two different symbols attached used a very primitive method (and I mean that in the pureset sense, in that <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">a - a = 0</script></span> is something you know at age five or earlier).  I hadnâ€™t grokked the fact that we can use this at a meta-level.</p>

<p>It makes you wonder what else we can go-meta withâ€¦</p>

<p><span class="newthought">It seems like weâ€™re on the brink of discovering a general rule about polynomials, roots and interpolation.</span>   Getting our specifics to something more wide-ranging is the point of Problem 166. Itâ€™s also going to be the last part of this post.</p>

<p>Gelfand gives us a massive tip here - we need to take the solution to Problem 164<label for="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">The one we worked through slowly above. </span> and generalise it.  Letâ€™s move step by step and see if we can.</p>

<p>Note, Iâ€™ve ended up following <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/243387607/Gelfand-Algebra-Solutions">Durham</a> <em>incredibly closely</em> here.  His explanation is as clear as I could make it so there seems like no point avoiding the fact.</p>

<p>First letâ€™s have our two polynomials <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">P(x)</script></span> and <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">Q(x)</script></span>, but letâ€™s say they are degree <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">n</script></span>, not degree <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">2</script></span> as we had previously.</p>

<p>Then letâ€™s have a bunch of values of <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">x</script></span> (<span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">n</script></span> of them in fact)</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3} \hbox{...} x_{n-1}, x_{n}, x_{n+1}</script></div>

<p>And subsequently letâ€™s state that in all cases, <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">P(x) = Q(x)</script></span></p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">P(x_{1}) = Q(x_{1})</script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">P(x_{2}) = Q(x_{2})</script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">P(x_{3}) = Q(x_{3})</script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">...</script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">P(x_{n-1}) = Q(x_{n-1})</script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">P(x_{n}) = Q(x_{n})</script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">P(x_{n+1}) = Q(x_{n+1})</script></div>

<p>Then again let <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">R(x) = P(x) - Q(x)</script></span></p>

<p>Which means</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">R(x_{1}) = R(x_{2}) = R(x_{3}) = \hbox{...} = R(x_{n-1}) = R(x_{n}) = R(x_{n+1}) = 0</script></div>

<p>So that means <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3} \hbox{...} x_{n-1}, x_{n}, x_{n+1}</script></span> are roots of <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">R</script></span>.</p>

<p>But <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">R</script></span> can have at most <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">n</script></span> roots, or it is identically equal to zero for all <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">x</script></span> therefore</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">0 = R(x) = P(x) - Q(x)</script></div>

<p>Or stated another way, <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">P(x) = Q(x)</script></span> for all <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">x</script></span>.</p>

<p>In other words, as Durham crisply concludes,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>whenever two <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">n</script></span> degree polynomials are equal on <span>â€‹<script type="math/tex">n+1</script></span>  or more points, they are the same polynomial.</p>

Iâ€™m going to tackle them in a separate post however.</p>

<p>This one has run on long enough.</p>
