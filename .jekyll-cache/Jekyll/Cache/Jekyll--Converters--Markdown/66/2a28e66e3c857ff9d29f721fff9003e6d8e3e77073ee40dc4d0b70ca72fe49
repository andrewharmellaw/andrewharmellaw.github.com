<h2 id="the-assocative-and-commutative-laws">The <em>Assocative</em> and <em>Commutative Laws</em></h2>
<p><span class="newthought">These laws allow you to jiggle around</span>  the numbers in your sums and multiplications, to make them easier to do in your head.<label for="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">and manipulate in other ways. </span></p>

<p>There are <em>Associative Laws</em> for addition:</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)</script></div>

<p>and multiplication:</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">(ab)c = a(bc)</script></div>

<p>The <em>Associative Laws</em> are all about the order in which you do the individual two-element sums / multiplications in a bigger expression.</p>

<p>There are <em>Commutative Laws</em> for addition:</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">a + b = b + a</script></div>

<p>and multiplication:</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">ab = ba</script></div>

<p>The <em>Commutative Laws</em> are about the fact you can move the order of numbers around in an expression.</p>

<p>Combined, the <em>Associative</em> and <em>Commutative Laws</em> are the basis of most tricks you probably know without knowing for handling mental arithmetic.  More on them below.</p>

<p>Some handy mnemonics<label for="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">taken from <a href="http://www.onlinemathlearning.com/pre-algebra-mnemonics.html">Onlinemathlearning.com</a>. </span> to remember these two laws are as follows:</p>

<p>The <em>Associative Law</em> is about association or <em>grouping</em> - who you are paired with?</p>

<p>The <em>Commutative Law</em> is about things being the same either way - like a <em>commute</em> to and from work</p>

<h2 id="the-distributive-law">The <em>Distributive Law</em></h2>
<p>The <em>Distributive Law</em> is a rule for removing parentheses:</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">c(a + b) = ca + cb </script></div>

<p>From Gelfand (pp. 15):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“To multiply two sums you need to multiply each term of the first sum by each term in the second one and then add them all together.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Additionally (from the Stewart Calculus “<a href="http://www.stewartcalculus.com/data/ESSENTIAL%20CALCULUS%20Early%20Transcendentals/upfiles/ess-reviewofalgebra.pdf">Review of Algebra</a>”) it’s worth nothing that putting <span>​<script type="math/tex">a = -1</script></span> into the <em>Distributive Law</em> you get:</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> -(b + c) = </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> = (-1)(b + c) = </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> = (-1)b + (-1)c </script></div>

<p>and so</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> -(b + c) = -b - c </script></div>

<p>A handy mnemonic to remember this law is as follows: the <em>Distributive Law</em> is about <em>distributing</em> or “giving out” things outside some parentheses to the things inside them.<label for="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Again this mnemonic is taken from <a href="http://www.onlinemathlearning.com/pre-algebra-mnemonics.html">Onlinemathlearning.com</a>. </span></p>

<p>We will see a <em>lot more</em> of the <em>Distributive Law</em> over the next few Chunks (and thereafter too).<label for="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Adding and removing parentheses seems to be the <em>raison d’etre</em> for algebraists. </span></p>

<h2 id="tricks-arising">Tricks Arising</h2>

<h3 id="simplifying-addition-with-the-associative-law">Simplifying Addition with the <em>Associative Law</em></h3>

<p>Example 1: when the pieces are already in place to simplify:</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">   1 + 357 + 17999 = </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> = 357 + (1 + 17999) = </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> = 357 + 18000 = </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> = 18357 </script></div>

<p>Example 2: when you need to do some splitting in order to get the simple parts:</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">    357 + 17999 = </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> = (356 + 1) + 17999 = </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> =  356 + (1 + 17999) = </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> =  356 + 18000 = </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> =  18356 </script></div>

<p>Remember, we saw in the <a href="https://andrewharmellaw.github.io/algebra/2016/11/16/gelfands-algebra-chunk-1-fundamentals">previous post</a> how we can use the <em>Associative Law</em> to make application of the <em>Standard Multiplcation Algorithm</em> simpler, and to spot patterns.</p>

<p>In all these cases we’re looking to arrange things so we can (re-)state our problem in terms of groups of numbers which are simpler to add / multiply. This “simpler” form is usually one where there are lots of <span>​<script type="math/tex">0</script></span>’s which ultimately results in lots of simple column arithmetic, and therefore no carries, and therefore less to wrangle with in your working memory.<label for="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">And with less chance of errors. </span></p>

<h3 id="simplifying-multiplication-with-the-commutative-law">Simplifying Multiplication with the <em>Commutative Law</em></h3>

<p>Example 3: when the elements are already in place ready to be simplified:</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">37 \cdot 25 \cdot 4 = </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> = 37 \cdot 100 = </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> = 3700 </script></div>

<p>Example 4: when you need to do some splitting in order to get to your simple elements:</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">   125 \cdot 37 \cdot 8 = </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> = 5 \cdot 25 \cdot 8 \cdot 37 = </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> = 5 \cdot 200 \cdot 37 = </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> = 1000 \cdot 37 = </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> = 37000 </script></div>

<p>Again we’re looking to arrange things so we can (re-)state our problem in terms of groups of numbers which are simpler to add  / multiply.</p>

<p>But can we take this trick of “re-arrangement” further and add even more to our kit bag?  The answer is “yes”, and it’s also our first encounter with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss">Carl Friedrich Gauss</a>, to many the mathematicians mathematician.</p>

<p>To see this, take a look at Problem 35 (pp. 14) in Gelfand.</p>

<h3 id="remove-parentheses-with-the-distributive-law">Remove Parentheses with the <em>Distributive Law</em></h3>

<p>Example 5: the <em>Distributive Law</em> can be applied to remove parentheses in increasingly complex scenarios simply by:</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> (m+n)(a+b) = </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> = ma + mb + na + nb </script></div>

<h3 id="split-a-number-into-two-numbers-which-sum--multiply-to-the-same-result-if-its-useful">Split a number into two numbers which sum / multiply to the same result if it’s useful</h3>
<p>e.g.</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> 0 = -5 + 5 </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> 125 = 5 \cdot 25 </script></div>

<h2 id="why-u-no-laws-for-division">Why U No Laws for Division?</h2>
<p><span class="newthought">Remember in the <a href="https://andrewharmellaw.github.io/algebra/2016/11/16/gelfands-algebra-chunk-1-fundamentals">previous post</a></span>  where we said that “multiplication and division” were kind-of-but-not-really the same sides of a coin? Remember then that we had to trail the concepts of “Not Defined” and “Real” and “Rational” Numbers?</p>

<p>Well now here is another fly in the ointment - why are there no equivalents of these three laws for division? Things are looking less and less simple aren’t they?</p>
