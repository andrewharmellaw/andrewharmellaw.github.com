<p><span class="newthought">I‚Äôm not (for now) going to provide any gloss or commentary on sections 44 and 45 of Gelfand,</span>  nor do I see much purpose in adding to the builds provded by Durham.</p>

<p>I might come back to them later I suppose, but at the moment it seems unnecessary.</p>

<p>Instead, you can jump straight to Section 46 with <a href="https://andrewharmellaw.github.io/2017/04/25/gelfands-algebra-chunk-24-equations-schmequations">Chunk 24 - Equations Schmequations</a> or you can take a detour via <a href="https://andrewharmellaw.github.io/2017/04/24/gelfands-algebra-aside-3-roots-roots-and-more-roots">a disambiguation  of the various meanings in Mathematics of the word ‚ÄúRoot‚Äù</a>.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs your choice.</p>
