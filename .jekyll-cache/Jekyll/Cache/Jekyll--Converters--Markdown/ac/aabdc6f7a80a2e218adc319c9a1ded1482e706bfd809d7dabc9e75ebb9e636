<p><span class="newthought">This is another pretty straight-forward section.</span>   I‚Äôm going to leave Gelfand pretty largely to his own devices, only occasionally providing a summary-gloss over the top.  You might find it useful to read this chunk in it‚Äôs entirety, then work through the section in Gelfand, before coming back here again to check your chunk is embedded nicely.</p>

<h2 id="racing-through-the-sums">Racing Through the Sums</h2>

<p><span class="newthought">Section 39 ended with a question</span>  about calculating the number of terms in a given <em>Arithmetic Progression</em>. Section 40 opens by using that technique to calculate the sum of the values in a specified range of a given arithmetic progression.</p>

<p>As is his general style, Gelfand begins by asking us to solve a specific problmem in our current domain.  This comes in Problem 185.<label for="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">The solution to this problem might remind you of the Gauss solution to Problem 33 which we saw back in [Chunk </span></p>

<p>The next Problem<label for="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Problem 186. </span> asks us to figure out a general formula for sums of terms.  This is solved for us, and makes a lot of sense if we self-solved problem 185, and also if we looked back at chunk 2.  The general formula is just a symbolic representation of this pairing <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">(a + b)</script></span> and subsequent multiplication of this by <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">\frac{n}{2}</script></span>.</p>

<p>Problem 187 then points out that we might have been tripped up had we had an odd number of terms.<label for="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Dammit! </span></p>

<p>Those dashed odd-numbers again!  Note that the forumla derived to calculate the answer is unchanged, but the mental model that you might be using to get there needs more detail.</p>

<p>Not content with explaining this to us numerically, Gelfand then breaks into some of his glorious imagery to explain the latest solution to the current problem in hand.  Personally I found this second approach mentally-sticky (in a good way) and it‚Äôs lodged up in my brain box nice and solid with very little rehersal as a consequence.</p>

<p>There is a reason Gelfand gave us a picture, and also a reason for his stressing of the <em>arithmetic</em> in the name of the progression; it‚Äôs because he was about to introduce the next level of complexity in Problem 188.</p>

<p>This problem is about to illustrate a key property of the <em>Geometric Progression</em> that is known as ‚Äúthe odd numbers‚Äù - that their sums are always perfect squares.</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">1 = 1^2</script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">1 + 3 = 4 = 2^2</script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">1 + 3 + 5 = 9 = 3^2</script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16= 4^2</script></div>

<p>etc.</p>

<p>This all very good, but how do we <em>prove</em> this is always the case?  By dropping to the formulas that‚Äôs how.</p>

<p>Remember, from Problem 186 the formula we need to calculate is</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{n(a + b)}{2}</script></div>

<p>And here <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">a = 1</script></span> and <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">b = 2n - 1</script></span><label for="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">The formula for calculating any nth odd number. </span></p>

<p>Putting the together we get</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{n(1 + 2n - 1)}{2}</script></div>

<p>And simplifying</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> = \frac{n(2n)}{2} = </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> = \frac{n(2n)}{2} = </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> = n^2</script></div>

<p>Proven!  <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">n^2</script></span> it is.</p>
