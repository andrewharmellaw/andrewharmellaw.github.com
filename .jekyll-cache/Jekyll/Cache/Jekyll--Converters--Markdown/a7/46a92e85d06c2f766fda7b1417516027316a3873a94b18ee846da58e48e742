<p><span class="newthought">I’m not sure if it was intended,</span>  but after the previous mind-bending of polynomial regression; the next section<label for="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Section 39. </span> is a blessed relief.</p>

<p>Consequently, I’m going to restrict myself to simply summarising here the main points arising.</p>

<p>It’s for my benefit mostly.  If you’re working through Gelfand’s book, I suggest you do the problems yourself to help the chunk embed.</p>

<h2 id="definition">Definition</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>An <em>Arithmetic Progression</em> is a sequence of numbers where each term is a sum of the preceeding one and a <em>fixed number</em>. This fixed number is called the <em>common difference</em>, or simply <em>difference</em> of the <em>Arithmetic Progression</em>.</p>

<h2 id="key-facts-about-arithmetic-progressions">Key Facts about Arithmetic Progressions</h2>
<ul>
  <li><em>Arithmetic Progressions</em> can go forwards<label for="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">In which case the difference is positive. </span></li>
  <li><em>Arithmetic Progressions</em> can also go backwards<label for="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">In which case the difference is negative. </span></li>
  <li>You can find the next term in an <em>Arithmetic Progression</em> given only the two preceeding numbers<label for="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">See Problem 173 </span></li>
  <li>If you know enough of an <em>Arithmetic Progression</em> to know the details (the start value and the difference) then you can calculate the nth term<label for="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">See Problems 174, 175 and 176. </span></li>
  <li>There is a formula for <em>Arithmetic Progressions</em>, where <span>​<script type="math/tex">a</script></span> is the starting point, <span>​<script type="math/tex">d</script></span> handily signifies the difference, and <span>​<script type="math/tex">n</script></span> the term you’re wanting to calculate. The most basic formula is <span>​<script type="math/tex">a + (n - 1)d</script></span><label for="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">See Problem 177. </span></li>
  <li>To make an <em>Arithmetic Progression</em> go backwards, reverse the sign of the <span>​<script type="math/tex">d</script></span>.  In this case the actual <em>size</em> of <span>​<script type="math/tex">d</script></span> is unchanged<label for="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">See Problem 178. </span></li>
  <li>You can remove every second value in an <em>Arithmetic Progression</em> and still have an <em>Arithmetic Progression</em>. In this case its difference will be <span>​<script type="math/tex">2d</script></span><label for="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">See Problem 179. </span></li>
  <li>You <em>cannot</em> remove every third value in an <em>Arithmetic Progression</em> without it stopping being an <em>Arithmetic Progression</em>. This because the difference will no longer be fixed<label for="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">See Problem 180. </span></li>
  <li>The difference need not be a whole number<label for="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">See Problem 181. </span></li>
  <li>You can find the middle term between two known terms (<span>​<script type="math/tex">a</script></span> and <span>​<script type="math/tex">b</script></span>) using the formula <span>​<script type="math/tex">\frac{(a + b)}{2}</script></span><label for="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">See Problem 182. Note: this is also the formula for calculating an average of a and b. </span></li>
  <li>You can calculate all terms in a progression as long as you know the starting term value, the end term value, and the end term position (e.g. “fourth”)<label for="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">See Problem 183. </span></li>
  <li>You can calculate the number of terms in a given progression given a starting term, an end term, and a known term between the two (including the number of that term - e.g. “the third term”)<label for="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">See Problem 184. </span></li>
</ul>

<p>That’s all for this post.  I’m sure it will all come into play when we launch into Section 40, which is up next.</p>
