<p><span class="newthought">As I mentioned at the close of <a href="https://andrewharmellaw.github.io/2017/03/23/gelfands-algebra-chunk-22-geometric-progression-sums">the previous chunk</a>,</span>  this next part (Section 43) is one of Gelfand‚Äôs now-familiar ‚Äúmoar problems to embed and highlight subtleties and techniques from before‚Äù sections.</p>

<p>I used to think them a bit boring.  I now realise that it‚Äôs in these that a good deal of the gold is hidden.</p>

<p>Consequently I‚Äôm going to go slowly.  Again, possibly too slowly for some, but my aim is simply to make sure we squeeze out all the goodness and siphon it up into our brainboxes, ready for later deployment.</p>

<h2 id="problem-204">Problem 204</h2>
<p><span class="newthought">This is a nice problem to start with.</span>   Let‚Äôs begin to tackle it as we always do by taking our inputs and laying them out nicely ready for deployment in solutioning.</p>

<p>We know that we can represent a value in an <em>arithmetic</em> progression<label for="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">key point, we are going back in time a bit here </span> as the product of a starting value (which we‚Äôll keep calling <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">a</script></span>), the difference between terms (which we‚Äôll keep calling <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">d</script></span>), and numbers representing the position of the terms in the progression (which we‚Äôll call <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">n_x, n_y</script></span> and <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">n_z</script></span>).</p>

<p>What is more, if two or more terms are to be in the same progression, then they will share the values of <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">a</script></span> and <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">d</script></span> - the starting value and difference respectively. (A small aside: it‚Äôs not actually this simple, progressions can have different <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">a</script></span> values, but still overlap in terms of terms [sic - sorry], but this simplified view works for us here.)</p>

<p>With that in mind, we can specify our fractions separately in terms of this before seeing if they hang together [sic].</p>

<p>Note I‚Äôve arranged the fractions in increasing order of magnitude. This means our <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">d</script></span> will be positive.  Things could just as easily go the other way, in which case <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">d</script></span> would be negative.  This just keeps things simpler I‚Äôve found.</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{1}{5} = a + (n_x - 1)d</script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{1}{3} = a + (n_y - 1)d</script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{1}{2} = a + (n_z - 1)d</script></div>

<p>How can we simplify these?  The easiest way might be to guess that the starting point, <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">a</script></span>, was zero.  That leaves us with</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{1}{5} = (n_x - 1)d</script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{1}{3} = (n_y - 1)d</script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{1}{2} = (n_z - 1)d</script></div>

<p>Now how do we shuffle these so that <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">d</script></span> is isolated in each?</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \frac{1}{5} = (n_x - 1)d </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\rightarrow d = \frac{\frac{1}{5}}{(n_x - 1)}</script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\rightarrow d = \frac{1}{5} \cdot \frac{1}{(n_x - 1)}</script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\rightarrow d = \frac{1}{5(n_x - 1)}</script></div>

<p>Nice.<label for="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">If you need a reminder about the rules for fiddling with fractions, take a peek back at <a href="https://andrewharmellaw.github.io/2016/11/30/gelfands-algebra-chunk-4-fractions-urgh">Chunk 4 - Fractions (Urgh)</a>. </span></p>

<p>We‚Äôre able to rearrange our other starter expressions in the same way. I won‚Äôt bore you with the working for them. Instead let‚Äôs jump to laying them all out side by side as an equality:</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">d = \frac{1}{5(n_x - 1)} = \frac{1}{3(n_y - 1)} = \frac{1}{2(n_z - 1)}</script></div>

<p>Now, we know that in our case, <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">n_x</script></span>, <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">n_y</script></span> and <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">n_z</script></span> are different values because they represent different terms in our progression.  The question is, can we find values for them that mean everything still stays valid?</p>

<p>It‚Äôs at this point that I‚Äôm happy to make a mental leap and simplify things.  I think the following is self-evident</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\rightarrow 5(n_x - 1) = 3(n_y - 1) = 2(n_z - 1)</script></div>

<p>And from this point, we can take a trick we know from finding common denominators and work out that <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">d</script></span> is <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">30</script></span><label for="sn-id-whetever" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-whetever" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Or you can take this from Gelfand‚Äôs tip, but I‚Äôm trying to be good and get there without it. </span> and from there work out <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">n_x</script></span>, <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">n_y</script></span> and <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">n_z</script></span>.</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">5 \times ((3 \times 2 + 1) - 1 ) = 30</script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \rightarrow n_x = (3 \times 2) + 1 = 7 </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">3 \times ((5 \times 2 + 1) - 1 ) = 30</script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \rightarrow n_y = (5 \times 2) + 1 = 11 </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">2 \times ((5 \times 3 + 1) - 1 ) = 30</script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \rightarrow n_z = (5 \times 3) + 1 = 16 </script></div>

<p>We‚Äôve actually overshot here. The question was only to find out if the three terms could exist on the same arithmetic progression.  Clearly they do, at points <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">7</script></span>, <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">11</script></span> and <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">13</script></span> where the difference is <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">\frac{1}{30}</script></span>.</p>

<h3 id="was-there-a-shortcut">Was There a Shortcut?</h3>
<p>Hell yes.  <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/243387607/Gelfand-Algebra-Solutions">Durham</a> spotted the common-denominator trick based on the fact that <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">30 = 2 \times 3 \times 5</script></span> before any fiddling around.  I‚Äôm guessing that kind of insight comes with practice and confidence.  I‚Äôm personally happy that I worked it all the way through.</p>

<h2 id="problem-205">Problem 205</h2>
<p>We‚Äôll keep going with our all-the-gory-details working for this next problem.  Ignoring how Gelfand suggests we solve it for a second, let‚Äôs take a similarly slow and steady process like we did before and see where that gets us.</p>

<p>First up we know again that there must be a starting point <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">a</script></span>.<label for="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Because there always is. </span>  There must also a ratio <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">q</script></span> and a number representing the position of the term in the progression (which we‚Äôll again call <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">n_x, n_y</script></span> and <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">n_z</script></span>).</p>

<p>Yet again, if things are to be in the same <em>Geometric Progression</em><label for="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Note we‚Äôre not in arithmetic land any more. </span> then <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">a</script></span> and <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">q</script></span> <em>must</em> be the same in each case.</p>

<p>Now we can specify our terms in the form of expressions:</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">2 = a + q^{n_x - 1}</script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">3 = a + q^{n_y - 1}</script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">5 = a + q^{n_z - 1}</script></div>

<p>Let‚Äôs now try and isolate <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">q</script></span>, just like we previously isolated <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">d</script></span>.</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">2 = a + q^{n_x - 1}</script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\rightarrow q^{n_x - 1} = 2 - a</script></div>

<p>Hmmm, this is about to get all kinds of complicated trying to drag <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">q</script></span> out into the open on this one.</p>

<p>Is there another way?</p>

<p>There is, and Gelfand wanted to show it to us but we prevuously ignored him. Let‚Äôs admit defeat and see what he has to say.</p>

<p>Rather than specifying our terms in terms [sic] of the progression we know nothing about, he‚Äôs going to help us specify them in terms of each other.</p>

<p>This sounds like a bit of a leap, but it‚Äôs far simpler once you see it.</p>

<p>Firstly however, why can we do this?  The answer is that we already know they are related simply because of how progressions work - each subsequent term derives from the one before it.<label for="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">N.b. they are part of the same progression, the question relies upon it. </span></p>

<p>Before we get to it, we need one more piece of info - the knowledge of the order in which these terms appear in our as-yet-unknown progression.  It‚Äôs a safe bet to start with their being in ascending order, but remember Section 42, <a href="https://andrewharmellaw.github.io/2017/03/21/gelfands-algebra-chunk-21-geometric-progressions">back in Chunk 21</a>? There we found that sometimes in geometric progressions we can flip and flop from positive to negative and back to positive again.  Don‚Äôt worry about that for now - Gelfand will come back to it later. Luckily we know that our terms are all positive, and so we are pretty safe in dealing with them in the order <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">2 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 5</script></span>.</p>

<p>With this in mind, we can now specifiy them in terms of each other.  First up is <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">3</script></span>, specified in terms of <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">2</script></span></p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">3 = 2q^n</script></div>

<p>Just to be super-clear, and remembering that all progressions accumulate as you go, you can specify later terms by taking prior ones, and multiplying them by powers of q.  We don‚Äôt know what power, so that‚Äôs why Gelfand has used <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">n</script></span> here.</p>

<p>With that done we now specify <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">5</script></span> in terms of <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">3</script></span></p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">5 = 3q^m</script></div>

<p>The pattern is the same - still a prior term multiplied by a certain power of the same ratio <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">1</script></span>, but because we don‚Äôt know how many terms are between <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">3</script></span> and <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">5</script></span> we have to have a potentially different power of <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">q</script></span> from the one we used before. We‚Äôve got <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">m</script></span> to represent this.</p>

<p>With this, evidently simpler pair of expressions we can start putting them into a form where we can compare them.  First, Gelfand begins to isolate the <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">q</script></span>s.</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">q^n = \frac{3}{2}</script></div>

<p>and</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">q^m = \frac{5}{3}</script></div>

<p>And then pulling them together by raising both sides of the former equality to the power of the latter, and vice versa.</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">q^{mn} = (\frac{3}{2})^m</script></div>

<p>and</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">q^{mn} = (\frac{5}{3})^n</script></div>

<p>Allows us to then combine as</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">(\frac{3}{2})^m = q^{mn} = (\frac{5}{3})^n</script></div>

<p>And now we can drop <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">q</script></span> altogether, because if we can prove that this new merged equality is valid, then we‚Äôve proven the three starting terms can exist in a single geometric progression.</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{3^m}{2^m} = \frac{5^n}{3^n}</script></div>

<p>Simplifying again we can remove our fractions by multiplying the numerator of each by the denominator of the other</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">3^m \cdot 3^n = 2^m \cdot 5^n</script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\rightarrow 3^{m + n} = 2^m \cdot 5^n</script></div>

<p>Now Gelfand gets clever, showing us a new trick, and one of the real points of this problem I‚Äôll wager.</p>

<p>Clearly we can go no further trying to figure out <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">m</script></span> and <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">n</script></span>.  Nor would it profit us to do so.  But we could see what statements we can make about what we do have in our hands.</p>

<p>First up, Gelfand spots that the left hand side (<span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">3^{m + n}</script></span>) <em>must</em> be odd.  Seems like a leap? Try it out.  This is because <em>an odd number, no matter what power it is raised to, is always odd</em>.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs great info.  Now there are a few more moving parts on the right hand side (<span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">2^m \cdot 5^n</script></span>).  What can we say about that?</p>

<p>We know from what we just saw, that <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">5^n</script></span>, no matter what <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">n</script></span> is, will also always be odd.  That leaves the <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">2^m</script></span>.  We should now see that <em>even numbers, when raised to any power will always be even, except when raised to the power of <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">0</script></span></em>.  E.g. in our case with <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">2^m</script></span></p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">2^0 = 1</script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">2^1 = 2</script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">2^2 = 4</script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">2^3 = 8</script></div>

<p>Etc.</p>

<p>The final piece of the puzzle are the rules for multiplication of odd and even numbers. Let‚Äôs list them as it‚Äôs easier</p>

<ul>
  <li>even numbers multiplied by even numbers always give even results</li>
  <li>odd numbers multiplied by even numbers always give even results</li>
  <li>odd numbers multiplied by odd numbers always give odd results</li>
</ul>

<p>If we put all this together, we can see that the left side of our equality will <em>always</em> be odd, but the right hand side can <em>only ever</em> be odd when <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">m = 0</script></span>.</p>

<p>So, following the trail of clues like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_Marple">Miss Marple</a>, we next need to look at what does happen when <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">m = 0</script></span>.</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">3^{m + n} = 2^m \cdot 5^n</script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\rightarrow 3^{0 + n} = 2^0 \cdot 5^n</script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\rightarrow 3^n = 1 \cdot 5^n</script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\rightarrow 3^n = 5^n</script></div>

<p>Hmmm. That can‚Äôt be right, which means we can‚Äôt have these three terms being part of the same geometric progression.  Problem solved.</p>

<h2 id="tricks-arising-pt-1">Tricks Arising (Pt. 1)</h2>

<h3 id="when-proving-equalities-remember-fundamentals">When Proving Equalities, Remember Fundamentals</h3>
<p>We knew above that our equality was actually an inequality because we remembered<label for="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Prodded by Gelfand I‚Äôll admit </span> that there are some fundamental truisms about odd and even numbers and what you get when you multiply them.  There are probably others which are equally useful but I‚Äôve not had to use them in a problem yet:</p>

<ul>
  <li>dividing by zero giving ‚Äúundefined‚Äù is one likely candidate,</li>
  <li>anything multiplied by zero being zero being another,</li>
  <li>and multiplication of positive and negative numbers being the last that I can think of.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="revisiting-problem-204">Revisiting Problem 204</h2>
<p>It was super-useful to define the terms in terms [sic]<label for="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Still sorry. </span> of each other in Problem 205.  Could we have made things simpler for ourselves by taking a similar approach in Problem 204?</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{5} + (n \cdot x)</script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{3} + (m \cdot x)</script></div>

<p>Then we can isolate the <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">x</script></span>s. The first equality is up first</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{5} = n \cdot x</script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\rightarrow \frac{(\frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{5})}{n} = x</script></div>

<p>Then the second equality</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{3} = m \cdot x</script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\rightarrow \frac{(\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{3})}{m} = x</script></div>

<p>Then combining</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\rightarrow \frac{(\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{3})}{m} = x = \frac{(\frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{5})}{n}</script></div>

<p>And dropping the <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">x</script></span> altogether</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\rightarrow \frac{(\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{3})}{m} = \frac{(\frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{5})}{n}</script></div>

<p>Then it makes sense to make the denominators of all the top-fractions equal:</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\rightarrow \frac{(\frac{15}{30} - \frac{10}{30})}{m} = \frac{(\frac{10}{30} - \frac{6}{30})}{n}</script></div>

<p>And do the simple sums</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\rightarrow \frac{\frac{5}{30}}{m} = \frac{\frac{4}{30}}{n}</script></div>

<p>And finally get to <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">m</script></span> and <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">n</script></span>.</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\rightarrow \frac{\frac{5}{30}}{m} - \frac{\frac{4}{30}}{n} = 0</script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\rightarrow \frac{n \cdot \frac{5}{30}}{m \cdot n} - \frac{m \cdot \frac{4}{30}}{n \cdot m} = 0</script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\rightarrow \frac{n \cdot \frac{5}{30} - m \cdot \frac{4}{30}}{m \cdot n} = 0</script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\rightarrow m \cdot \frac{5}{30} - n \cdot \frac{4}{30} = 0</script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\rightarrow m = \frac{4}{30} </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\rightarrow n = \frac{5}{30}</script></div>

<p>A great deal of this was unnecassary, but it felt reassuring to work it all through.  And to answer my own question, ‚Äúyes, I think this way was easier.‚Äù</p>

<h2 id="problem-206">Problem 206</h2>
<p><span class="newthought">I got tied up on this problem for ages.</span>   But it helped be embed<label for="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Hence the title of this chunk </span> progressions far more deeply as a consequence.</p>

<p>In this problem, Gelfand is asking us to try and think about things differently.  We know<label for="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Because he has shown us </span> that the terms <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">2, 3</script></span> and <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">5</script></span> can‚Äôt appear in a <em>Geometric Progression</em> <em>in the order presented</em> because he showed us it was so.  But what about if they occurred in another order? What, asks Gelfand, should we do in these circumstances?</p>

<p>It makes sense to look back at the previous two posts to see what is even possible in this regard.  We see our first one in <a href="https://andrewharmellaw.github.io/2017/03/21/gelfands-algebra-chunk-21-geometric-progressions">Chunk 21 - Geometric Progressions</a> section ‚ÄúThe ‚ÄòTwo Possibilities‚Äô Subtlety‚Äù.  Here we see that a negative quotient <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">q</script></span> can have our terms flipping from positive to negative.</p>

<p>There is another alternative in the next section of the same post - ‚ÄúThe ‚Äòis that Really a <em>Geometric Progression</em>‚Äô Subtlety‚Äù.  In this one we can see that after an initial value which could be anything, the rest of the progression is made up of zeros.</p>

<p>And the subsequent section contains our last possibility - ‚ÄúFlip it and Reverse it‚Äù.  It gives us the possibility that our progressions don‚Äôt have an increasing quotient <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">q</script></span>, rather that it might have a decreasing one.</p>

<p>So which of these might change the game in our present <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">3, 4, 5</script></span> situation?  Clearly the middle possibility, that the quotient is <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">0</script></span>, is out for us as we have three non-zero terms and this option allows us only one. If we were to tackle a progression of this kind it would be easy to spot.</p>

<p>That them leaves the other two.</p>

<p>The first possibility indicates we <em>could</em> have a negative quotient. We could still have a problem of this kind but sneakily stated only giving positive terms. Can this be happening here? The answer is ‚Äúno‚Äù. Progressions of this kind must also work when the quotient is positive, and we know that this doesn‚Äôt work for us.</p>

<p>The last possibility is that our progression might be going in reverse because our powers (<span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">m</script></span> and <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">n</script></span>) might be negative.  (Remember <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">n^-2 = \frac{1}{n^2}</script></span>). However, being simply the mirror of the situation we investigated in Problem 205, it‚Äôs existence does not negate the existence of the former. Therefore, if a progression is impossible in one direction, it is impossible in the other too.</p>

<p>We can therefore conclude that there are no possibilities when this might be a geometric progression given these three numbers, and that after confirming that it is not a progression where the quotient is zero, our original approach sufficed to prove that the other two options were also impossible.</p>

<p>Remember this leap? I‚Äôm not sure we‚Äôve pulled it out explicitly before.</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{3^n}{3^m} = \frac{5^n}{2^m}</script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\rightarrow 3^n \times 2^m = 3^m \times 5^n</script></div>

<p>Gelfand does it himself in his solution to Problem 205.  You simply taken the numerator of one side, and multiply it with the denominator of the other side. That gives you one simplification. Then you do the reverse fo the other side.</p>

<p>Brilliant.</p>

<h3 id="think-logically---thats-maths-too">Think logically - that‚Äôs Maths too!</h3>
<p>We‚Äôre slowly building up a mental set of rules - things which we know always happen, and you can set these against each other logically to reduce the number of options you‚Äôre facing.</p>

<p>We saw this brilliantly in this problem.  I‚Äôm betting it‚Äôll come in handy again.</p>

<h2 id="problem-207">Problem 207</h2>
<p><span class="newthought">Not so much a problem as a statement this one.</span>   We‚Äôre back at <em>Arithmetic Progressions</em> again, and you‚Äôre supposed to think about the difference as we have the first two terms.</p>

<p>In the case mentioned, we know we start with an integer, and then we have a second term which is also an integer.  That means the difference must also be an integer.  And if you add integers to integers, all you ever get are integers.</p>

<p>That means it is impossible to have an <em>Arithmetic Progression</em> where the first two terms are integers, but all subsequent ones are not.</p>

<h2 id="problem-208">Problem 208</h2>
<p><span class="newthought">This is a similar problem to 207,</span>  but we‚Äôre now talking about <em>Geometric Progressions</em>.  We saw in our discussion for Problem 206 (above) that <em>Geometric Progressions</em> can go backwards, and that when the powers of the quotient flip from positive to negative then we enter the realm of fractions with a numerator of <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">1</script></span>, and stay there.  And what is such a fraction not? An integer, that‚Äôs what.</p>

<h2 id="problem-209">Problem 209</h2>
<p><span class="newthought">We‚Äôve flipped back to <em>Arithmetic Progressions</em> again.</span>   Remember that in this type, the difference must always be the same, and if the second term is less than the first, but also less than the third, then this doesn‚Äôt hold true, because as Gelfand points out, the difference, which might be of the same magnitude, would be positive and negative at the same time, which is <em>verboten</em>.</p>

<h2 id="problem-210">Problem 210</h2>
<p><span class="newthought"><em>Geometric Progression</em> once again.</span>   Now it is handy to recall Problem 205 again.  <em>Geometric Progressions</em> <em>can</em> flip-flop, from positive to negative, when the quotient is negative.  That means it is possible to have a <em>Geometric Progression</em> where the second term is less than the first term, and also less than the third term.</p>

<h2 id="problem-211">Problem 211</h2>
<p><span class="newthought">Now we‚Äôre back on our own again.</span>  Well, almost.  Gelfand does give us a hint, but let‚Äôs see what we can make of things before we take him up on it.</p>

<p>First let‚Äôs lay out what we know:</p>

<ul>
  <li>we‚Äôre talking about <em>Arithmetic Progressions</em>, which means all our terms can be calculated by the formula <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">x = a + (n - 1) \cdot d</script></span></li>
  <li>we need to have ‚Äúexactly one integer term‚Äù which means all terms must be the same</li>
</ul>

<p>Following this logic through, that means that to achieve this, then the difference between terms must be zero (<span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">d = 0</script></span>).</p>

<p>Does that tell us what our starting point needs to be?  Nope, we can pick anything we want (i.e. <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">a</script></span> can be anything).</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs see how that plays out:</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">n = 1 \rightarrow a + (1 - 1) \cdot 0 = a + 0 = a</script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">n = 2 \rightarrow a + (2 - 1) \cdot 0 = a + 0 = a</script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">n = 3 \rightarrow a + (3 - 1) \cdot 0 = a + 0 = a</script></div>

<p>Etc. Etc. ad infinitum.</p>

<p>It seems that you <em>can</em> have an <em>Arithmetic Progression</em> which contains exactly one integer term.</p>

<p>But there is a problem with this.  Have we misunderstood the question?  Does Gelfand <em>really</em> mean that we want to find an <em>Arithmetic Progression</em> which has one integer term, and all other terms are non-integers?</p>

<p>If that is the case, then it‚Äôs time to take him up on his offer of the hint.</p>

<p>Again, let‚Äôs start by laying out what we know:</p>

<ul>
  <li>we‚Äôre still talking about <em>Arithmetic Progressions</em>, which means all our terms can be calculated by the formula <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">x = a + (n - 1) \cdot d</script></span></li>
  <li>the hint tells us that we‚Äôre starting at zero, which means <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">a = 0</script></span>. This is our single integer</li>
  <li>and it is also hinted that we use a difference, <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">d</script></span> of <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">\sqrt{2}</script></span></li>
</ul>

<p>Given all this, then the <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">n</script></span>th term will be <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">0 + (n - 1) \cdot \sqrt{2}</script></span>. It is essential that this be a non-integer when <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">n \gt 1</script></span>  (i.e. all subsequent terms) if we are to find the progression Gelfand is looking for.</p>

<p>We can simplify this, stating that all terms other than the first (i.e. where <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">n \gt 1</script></span>) will be in the form <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">b \cdot \sqrt{2}</script></span>.</p>

<p>It is in this that we need to find our solution, well, actually the reason that <em>this is our solution</em>.  How do we know that <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">b \cdot \sqrt{2}</script></span> will never give us an integer?</p>

<p>We can approach this from the reverse angle.  If, instead of <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">d = \sqrt{2}</script></span> our <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">d</script></span> was an integer, clearly our progression would contain lots more integers, which is a failure.  If on the other hand, our <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">d</script></span> was a <em>Rational Number</em> (a number that can be written as a ratio, i.e. as a fraction) then eventually, as we moved through the progression, we would get to a multiple of that fraction which was a whole number, an integer, and we woulf fail again.</p>

<p>What we need then is a number which no matter how many times you multiply it, <em>it never becomes an integer</em>.  For that we need an <em>Irrational Number</em>.  The simplest one of these that we know of is <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">\sqrt{2}</script></span>.  That‚Äôs why Gelfand picked it.</p>

<p>This all seems a little mind-bending. We‚Äôll get around to <em>Irrational Numbers</em> in a later chunk so please trust me and don‚Äôt worry about it too much for now.</p>

<h2 id="problem-212">Problem 212</h2>
<p><span class="newthought">Given what we‚Äôve seen,</span>  it‚Äôs now quite clear why Gelfand answers this problem with a single word - ‚Äúno‚Äù.  There is no <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">d</script></span> which we can use in an arithmetical progression which will give us one more integer after the starting figure <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">a</script></span>, and then never give us one again.</p>

<h2 id="problem-213">Problem 213</h2>
<p><span class="newthought">This one is a simple <em>Geometric Progression</em>,</span>  but with a little bit of fiddling after the fact.</p>

<p>Remember this from <a href="https://andrewharmellaw.github.io/2017/03/21/gelfands-algebra-chunk-21-geometric-progressions">‚ÄúChunk 21 - Geometric Progressions‚Äù</a>?</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">2^1 = 2</script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">2^2 = 4</script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">2^3 = 8</script></div>

<p>Which came from</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">a \cdot q^{n-1}</script></div>

<p>Here, our numbers are just one less than that.  I.e.</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">2^1 - 1 = 1</script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">2^2 - 1 = 3</script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">2^3 - 1 = 7</script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">2^4 - 1 = 15</script></div>

<p>Which means the <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">100</script></span>th term will be <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">2^{100} - 1</script></span>.</p>

<h2 id="problem-214">Problem 214</h2>
<p><span class="newthought">I‚Äôll come back to this once I get to <em>Quadratic Equations</em></span>  which Gelfand points out in his Hint.</p>

<h2 id="problem-215">Problem 215</h2>
<p><span class="newthought">The Fibbonacci sequence</span>  (which will be <em>incredibly</em> familiar to anyone who does any form of agile software development) is a geometric sequence which follows the pattern identified in Problem 214.</p>

<p>So what are we being asked to obtain in this problem?  Gelfand wants us to find out what <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">A</script></span>, and <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">B</script></span> are.</p>

<p>The simplest way to do this is the approach taken by Durham (but here using my characteristic, every-microscopic-step-shown style).  We know that this <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">A</script></span> / <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">B</script></span> formula helps you work out any given term in the Fibbonacci sequence if you know it‚Äôs position (i.e. it‚Äôs <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">n</script></span>).</p>

<p>We also know some of the answers already, and so given that we can plug our <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">n</script></span>, and our result into this formula for two scenarios and then cross-reference the results.</p>

<p>For us, that means calculating using the simplest two knowns which are the first and second terms: <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">1</script></span> (when <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">n = 1</script></span>) and <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">1</script></span> (when <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">n = 2</script></span>).</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs our starting formula. We‚Äôll begin by using it with the first term (<span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">1</script></span> with the corresponding <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">n</script></span> of <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">1</script></span>):</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">A(\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}) + B(\frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2})</script></div>

<p>Let‚Äôs rearrange for <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">A</script></span> first.  We begin by plugging in what we know (a result of <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">1</script></span> and an <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">n</script></span> of <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">1</script></span>)</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">1 = A(\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2})^1 + B(\frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2})^1</script></div>

<p>And then we can remove our powers of 1</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\rightarrow 1 = A(\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}) + B(\frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2})</script></div>

<p>And them remove the parentheses</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\rightarrow 1 = A \cdot \frac{1}{2} + A \cdot \frac{\sqrt{5}}{2} + B \cdot \frac{1}{2} - B \cdot \frac {\sqrt{5}}{2}</script></div>

<p>Then multiply everything by <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">2</script></span></p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\rightarrow 2 = A + A \cdot \sqrt{5} + B - B \cdot \sqrt{5}</script></div>

<p>Then rearrange</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\rightarrow 2 = A + B + (A - B) \cdot \sqrt{5}</script></div>

<p>Now let‚Äôs rearrange for <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">B</script></span>.  We begin again by just plugging in what we know (this time a result of <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">1</script></span> but an <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">n</script></span> of <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">2</script></span>)</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">1 = A(\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2})^2 + B(\frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2})^2</script></div>

<p>And then we can apply our powers of <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">2</script></span></p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\rightarrow 1 = A(\frac{1 + 2 \cdot \sqrt{5} + 5}{4}) + B(\frac{1 - 2 \cdot \sqrt{5} + 5}{4})</script></div>

<p>And them remove the parentheses</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\rightarrow 1 = A \cdot \frac{1}{4} + A \cdot \frac{\sqrt{5}}{4} + A \cdot \frac{5}{4} + B \cdot \frac{1}{4} - B \cdot \frac {\sqrt{5}}{4} + B \cdot \frac{5}{4}</script></div>

<p>Then multiply everything by <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">4</script></span></p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\rightarrow 4 = 6 \cdot (A + B) + (A - B) \cdot 2 \cdot \sqrt{5}</script></div>

<p>Now we have these two pieces we can try and put them together.  The first equation is equal to <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">2</script></span>, but the second is equal to <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">4</script></span>, so let‚Äôs double the first equation</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">4 = 2 \cdot (A + B) + 2 \cdot (A - B) \cdot \sqrt{5}</script></div>

<p>Now we can put both our equations together</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">2 \cdot (A + B) + 2 \cdot (A - B) \cdot \sqrt{5} = 6 \cdot (A + B) + (A - B)  \cdot 2 \cdot \sqrt{5}</script></div>

<p>If we then simplify by subtracting <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">2 \cdot (A - B) \cdot \sqrt{5}</script></span> from both sides we get this</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">2 \cdot (A + B) = 6 \cdot (A + B)</script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\rightarrow 0 = 4 \cdot (A + B)</script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\rightarrow A + B = 0</script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\rightarrow A = -B</script></div>

<p>Phew! That‚Äôs quite a simplification.  Now that we know what <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">A</script></span> and <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">B</script></span> are in terms of each other, we can go back to the first of our rearranged equalities and obtain first <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">B</script></span>, and then from that <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">A</script></span>.</p>

<p>Taking</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> 2 = A + B + (A - B) \cdot \sqrt{5}</script></div>

<p>and swapping each <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">A</script></span> for <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">-B</script></span> we get</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> 2 = (-B + B) + (-B-B) \cdot \sqrt{5} = -2B \cdot \sqrt{5} </script></div>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \rightarrow B = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{5}} </script></div>

<p>And from there getting <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">A</script></span></p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \rightarrow A = -B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} </script></div>

<p>We could equally have done <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">A</script></span> first and from there obtained <span>‚Äã<script type="math/tex">B</script></span>, but I followed Durham to keep everything predictable.</p>

<h2 id="another-non-conclusion">Another (Non-)Conclusion</h2>
<p><span class="newthought">Blimey!</span>  That was a lot.  You‚Äôre probably reeling from the shock of it all.  I‚Äôd suggest re-reading all this again, perhaps working through some other options of th last problem, and then taking a break.</p>
